Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Fontaine progeroid syndrome - NIH Genetic Testing Registry\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Progeroid Syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:** Not specified in the provided text.  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Poor growth  \n- Abnormal skeletal features  \n- Distinctive craniofacial characteristics  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of poor growth with abnormal skeletal features and distinctive craniofacial characteristics, which may help distinguish it from other connective tissue disorders.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Distinctive craniofacial characteristics (specific details not provided in the text).  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Not specified in the provided text.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The triad of poor growth, abnormal skeletal features, and distinctive craniofacial characteristics strongly suggests progeroid syndrome.  \n\n(Note: The summary is limited by the lack of detailed information in the provided text.)\n",
