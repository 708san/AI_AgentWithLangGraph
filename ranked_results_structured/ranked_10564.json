  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII. Analytical Tool Reports\n\nPubCaseFinder Report (Phenotype-based):\n- congenital heart defects and skeletal malformations syndrome (Score: 0.857)\n- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliotic type 1 (Score: 0.845)\n- Loeys-Dietz syndrome 2 (Score: 0.809)\n- wrinkly skin syndrome (Score: 0.807)\n- ehlers-danlos syndrome, arthrochalasia type, 2 (Score: 0.807)\n\nZero-Shot Diagnosis Report (Generative AI-based):\n- EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, CLASSIC-LIKE, 1; EDSCLL1 (Rank: 1)\n- CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1; ADCL1 (Rank: 2)\n- GERODERMA OSTEODYSPLASTICUM; GO (Rank: 3)\n\nGestaltMatcher Report (Facial Dysmorphology-based):\n- Cutis laxa (Score: 0.450)\n- NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER WITH REGRESSION, ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS, LOSS OF SPEECH, AND SEIZURES; NEDAMSS (Score: 0.423)\n- SHORT STATURE, ONYCHODYSPLASIA, FACIAL DYSMORPHISM, AND HYPOTRICHOSIS; SOFT (Score: 0.418)\n- CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS, MULTIPLE TYPES, 2; CHTD2 (Score: 0.413)\n- Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (Score: 0.408)\n\nPhenotype Similarity Search Report (Vector-based):\n- EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, ARTHROCHALASIA TYPE, 1 (OMIM: 130060, Score: 0.768)\n- EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, SPONDYLODYSPLASTIC TYPE, 2 (OMIM: 615349, Score: 0.762)\n- EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, ARTHROCHALASIA TYPE, 2 (OMIM: 617821, Score: 0.754)\n- EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, KYPHOSCOLIOTIC TYPE, 2 (OMIM: 614557, Score: 0.746)\n- EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, KYPHOSCOLIOTIC TYPE, 1 (OMIM: 225400, Score: 0.741)\n\nIII. Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Slender long bone (Concept Id: C1833144) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (WDRTS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative gene(s): POLR3A  \n- Inheritance pattern: Autosomal recessive  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)  \n- Neonatal progeroid appearance (aged facial features, sparse scalp hair, prominent veins)  \n- Lipodystrophy (generalized loss of subcutaneous fat)  \n- Failure to thrive  \n- Hypotonia  \n- Intellectual disability  \n- Dental anomalies (e.g., delayed eruption, hypodontia)  \n- Sparse or absent eyebrows and eyelashes  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Neonatal onset of progeroid features, distinguishing it from other progeroid syndromes that typically present later in life.  \n- Generalized lipodystrophy present from birth, unlike segmental or progressive lipodystrophy seen in other conditions.  \n- Prominent scalp veins and sparse hair, which are more pronounced than in other progeroid syndromes.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Neonatal progeroid appearance with prominent scalp veins and sparse hair.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of progressive neurological decline, which is seen in some other progeroid syndromes.  \n- No evidence of hyperphagia, which is a feature of other syndromes with growth abnormalities.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The combination of neonatal progeroid appearance, generalized lipodystrophy, prominent scalp veins, and sparse hair, along with intrauterine growth retardation and intellectual disability, strongly suggests Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome.\n- Title: Downslanted palpebral fissures (Concept Id: C0423110) - MedGen\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nProteus syndrome (PS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative gene: *AKT1*  \n- Inheritance pattern: Sporadic (caused by post-zygotic mosaicism)  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Progressive, segmental, or patchy overgrowth of tissues  \n- Disproportionate skeletal overgrowth (e.g., macrodactyly, limb asymmetry)  \n- Connective tissue nevi (cerebriform or verrucous skin lesions)  \n- Vascular malformations (capillary, venous, or lymphatic)  \n- Lipomas or other adipose tissue abnormalities  \n- Overgrowth of visceral organs (e.g., spleen, liver)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Progressive nature of overgrowth, which is not present at birth but becomes apparent in early childhood  \n- Asymmetric and mosaic distribution of overgrowth  \n- Presence of cerebriform connective tissue nevi, which are highly characteristic  \n- Lack of family history due to sporadic occurrence  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Cerebriform connective tissue nevi (pathognomonic for Proteus syndrome)  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of intellectual disability (in most cases), which helps differentiate from other overgrowth syndromes like Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome  \n- Absence of generalized overgrowth at birth (overgrowth is segmental and develops postnatally)  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Progressive, asymmetric overgrowth combined with cerebriform connective tissue nevi and vascular malformations strongly suggests Proteus syndrome.\n",
