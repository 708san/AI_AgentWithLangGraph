Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1 (Concept Id: C4551851) - MedGen -\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative genes: NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, HDAC8  \n- Inheritance pattern: Autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC3, RAD21) or X-linked dominant (SMC1A, HDAC8)  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Distinctive facial features (arched eyebrows, synophrys, long eyelashes, small upturned nose, thin downturned lips)  \n- Growth retardation (prenatal and postnatal)  \n- Intellectual disability (mild to severe)  \n- Limb abnormalities (e.g., upper limb reduction defects, micromelia, oligodactyly)  \n- Hirsutism  \n- Gastroesophageal reflux  \n- Hearing loss  \n- Behavioral issues (e.g., self-injurious behavior, autism spectrum disorder features)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Limb abnormalities, particularly upper limb reduction defects, are more severe and characteristic compared to other syndromes with intellectual disability.  \n- Distinctive facial dysmorphism, including synophrys and long eyelashes, is highly suggestive of CdLS.  \n- Severe growth retardation with prenatal onset is a key differentiator.  \n- Behavioral issues, including self-injurious behavior, are more prominent in CdLS compared to other syndromes with intellectual disability.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Synophrys (unibrow)  \n- Severe upper limb reduction defects  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of progressive neurodegeneration (distinguishes from some other syndromes with intellectual disability).  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The combination of synophrys, severe upper limb reduction defects, prenatal growth retardation, and intellectual disability strongly points to Cornelia de Lange syndrome.\n- Title: Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia and speech delay,\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nNeurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia and speech delay, with or without seizures (NEDHSS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene(s): Variants in the IRF2BPL gene  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Global developmental delay  \n- Hypotonia  \n- Speech delay or absence of speech  \n- Intellectual disability  \n- Seizures (may be present or absent)  \n- Motor regression in some cases  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Progressive motor regression, which may not be seen in other neurodevelopmental disorders with similar features.  \n- Variability in seizure presence, as some individuals with NEDHSS do not develop seizures, unlike other syndromes where seizures are a consistent feature.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Progressive motor regression combined with hypotonia and speech delay.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of dysmorphic facial features, which are often present in other syndromes with developmental delay and intellectual disability.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The combination of global developmental delay, hypotonia, speech delay, and progressive motor regression, with or without seizures, strongly suggests NEDHSS, especially in the absence of dysmorphic features.\n- Title: Neurodevelopmental disorder with motor and speech delay and\n  Snippet: It seems you've provided only the beginning of the article.
