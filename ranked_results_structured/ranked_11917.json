Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

If you can provide the full article or additional context, I can assist further.\n- Title: Proptosis (Concept Id: C0015300) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nCrouzon syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative gene: *FGFR2*  \n- Inheritance pattern: Autosomal dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Craniosynostosis (premature fusion of cranial sutures)  \n- Midface hypoplasia  \n- Proptosis (protrusion of the eyes)  \n- Beaked nose  \n- Normal intelligence in most cases  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Absence of hand and foot anomalies (distinguishes from Apert syndrome)  \n- Normal limb development (distinguishes from Pfeiffer syndrome)  \n- Lack of significant skin findings (distinguishes from Muenke syndrome)  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Craniosynostosis with midface hypoplasia and proptosis  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of syndactyly (fusion of fingers or toes)  \n- No intellectual disability in most cases  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Combination of craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, and proptosis without limb anomalies or significant skin findings strongly suggests Crouzon syndrome.\n",
