Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: OMIM Entry - #272440 - FILIPPI SYNDROME; FLPIS - OMIM\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Filippi syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:** Unknown causative gene(s); likely autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Facial dysmorphism (specific features not detailed in the excerpt)  \n- Syndactyly of fingers and toes  \n- Growth retardation  \n- Postnatal microcephaly  \n- Developmental delay, particularly involving speech  \n- Unusual teeth  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of syndactyly with postnatal microcephaly and facial dysmorphism.  \n- Developmental delay with a specific emphasis on speech involvement.  \n- Presence of unusual dental features.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Syndactyly of fingers and toes.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Not specified in the provided text.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Syndactyly of fingers and toes, postnatal microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, developmental delay (speech-focused), and unusual teeth together strongly suggest Filippi syndrome.\n- Title: PubMed Central Microcephaly, Short Stature, Intellectual Disability, Speech Absence and Cataract Are Associated with Novel Bi-Allelic Missense Variant in RTTN Gene: A Seckel Syndrome Case Report - PMC\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nSeckel syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative genes: Multiple genes implicated, including ATR, RBBP8, and others.  \n- Inheritance pattern: Autosomal recessive.  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).  \n- Microcephaly (reduced frontal and occipital skull circumference).  \n- Intellectual disability.  \n- Distinct facial features: pointed nose, narrow face, receding forehead, and prominent eyes.  \n- Skeletal abnormalities, including short stature and limb malformations.  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of severe microcephaly with characteristic facial dysmorphism (pointed nose, narrow face).  \n- Disproportionate short stature with normal trunk length but shortened limbs.  \n- Prenatal onset of growth restriction.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Severe microcephaly with a \"bird-like\" facial appearance (pointed nose and narrow face).  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of organomegaly (distinguishing it from other syndromes with growth restriction, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome).  \n- No evidence of hyperphagia (distinguishing it from Prader-Willi syndrome).  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Severe prenatal growth restriction, microcephaly, and a \"bird-like\" facial appearance (pointed nose, narrow face) combined with short stature and limb abnormalities strongly suggest Seckel syndrome.\n- Title: Mild global developmental delay (Concept Id: C4012968) - MedGen\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not provide sufficient information to create a structured summary as per the instructions.
