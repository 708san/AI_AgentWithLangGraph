Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Isolated Pierre-Robin syndrome (Concept Id: C0031900) - MedGen\n  Snippet: The provided text appears to be medically related. Below is the structured summary:\n\n---\n\n**Disease:** Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS)\n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Associated with mutations in the SOX9 gene.  \n- Can occur as an isolated condition or as part of a syndromic presentation (e.g., Stickler syndrome).  \n- Inheritance pattern: Typically sporadic, but can be autosomal dominant in syndromic cases.\n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Mandibular hypoplasia (micrognathia).  \n- Cleft secondary palate.  \n- Glossoptosis (posterior displacement of the tongue).  \n- Airway obstruction leading to life-threatening apnea.  \n- Feeding difficulties.\n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of mandibular hypoplasia, cleft palate, and glossoptosis is highly suggestive of PRS.  \n- Airway obstruction is a prominent and early feature, often requiring intervention.  \n- May occur in isolation or as part of a syndrome (e.g., Stickler syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome).  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Triad of mandibular hypoplasia, cleft palate, and glossoptosis.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of limb anomalies (helps differentiate from syndromes like Treacher Collins syndrome).  \n- No significant craniosynostosis (distinguishes from craniofacial syndromes like Apert syndrome).  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The triad of mandibular hypoplasia, cleft secondary palate, and glossoptosis, particularly when associated with early-onset airway obstruction and feeding difficulties, strongly points to PRS.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or additional details!\n- Title: Current Genetic Testing Tools in Neonatal Medicine - Pediatrics\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to create a structured summary. Please provide the full article text for me to proceed with the task.\n- Title: Global Developmental Delay with Speech and Behavioral\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Global Developmental Delay with Speech and Behavioral Abnormalities (GDSBA)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene(s): Not specified in the provided text.  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant.  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Global developmental delay.  \n- Speech abnormalities.  \n- Behavioral abnormalities.  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Specific combination of developmental delay with prominent speech and behavioral abnormalities.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Not specified in the provided text.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Not specified in the provided text.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Developmental delay combined with speech and behavioral abnormalities, suggesting a distinct clinical presentation.  \n\n(Note: The provided text is incomplete, and additional details may be necessary to fully populate the summary.)\n- Title: Intellectual Developmental Disorder with Autism and Speech\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to create a structured summary as per the requested format.
