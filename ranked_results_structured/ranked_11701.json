Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked, syndromic 37\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not provide sufficient information to create a structured summary as per the instructions. If you can provide the full article or additional context, I can assist further.\n- Title: AHDC1-related intellectual disability - obstructive sleep apnea\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Xia-Gibbs Syndrome (XGS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene: AHDC1  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant (typically de novo mutations)  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Global developmental delay  \n- Delayed motor milestones  \n- Severe speech delay or absence of speech  \n- Intellectual disability  \n- Hypotonia  \n- Sleep disturbances (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea)  \n- Distinct craniofacial features (e.g., broad forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Severe speech delay or absence of speech is a prominent feature, often more pronounced than in other syndromes with developmental delay.  \n- Sleep disturbances, particularly obstructive sleep apnea, are common and may help differentiate from other syndromes with similar developmental delays.  \n- Specific craniofacial dysmorphisms, such as a broad forehead and downslanting palpebral fissures, are characteristic.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Pathogenic variants in the AHDC1 gene.  \n- Severe speech delay or absence of speech in the context of global developmental delay.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of hyperphagia, which may help distinguish from syndromes like Prader-Willi.  \n- No significant organ malformations, which are often present in other syndromes with developmental delay.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The combination of severe speech delay, global developmental delay, hypotonia, sleep disturbances (especially obstructive sleep apnea), and characteristic craniofacial features strongly suggests Xia-Gibbs Syndrome.\n",
