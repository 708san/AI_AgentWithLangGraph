Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII. Analytical Tool Reports\n\nPubCaseFinder Report (Phenotype-based):\n- Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome 1 (Score: 0.865)\n- lethal arthrogryposis-anterior horn cell disease syndrome (Score: 0.843)\n- Wieacker-Wolff syndrome (Score: 0.839)\n- arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 5 (Score: 0.839)\n- COG7-congenital disorder of glycosylation (Score: 0.809)\n\nZero-Shot Diagnosis Report (Generative AI-based):\n- CONGENITAL MYOPATHY 21 WITH EARLY RESPIRATORY FAILURE; CMYO21 (Rank: 1)\n- MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, ESCOBAR VARIANT; EVMPS (Rank: 2)\n- NEMALINE MYOPATHY 2; NEM2 (Rank: 4)\n- CONTRACTURAL ARACHNODACTYLY, CONGENITAL; CCA (Rank: 5)\n\nGestaltMatcher Report (Facial Dysmorphology-based):\n- OHDO SYNDROME, SBBYS VARIANT; SBBYSS (Score: 0.535)\n- CARDIAC, FACIAL, AND DIGITAL ANOMALIES WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; CAFDADD (Score: 0.501)\n- SCHUURS-HOEIJMAKERS SYNDROME; SHMS (Score: 0.492)\n- KAUFMAN OCULOCEREBROFACIAL SYNDROME; KOS (Score: 0.483)\n- KOOLEN-DE VRIES SYNDROME; KDVS (Score: 0.472)\n\nPhenotype Similarity Search Report (Vector-based):\n- GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY WITH NORMAL SERUM GLYCINE (OMIM: 617301, Score: 0.749)\n- CAREY-FINEMAN-ZITER SYNDROME 1 (OMIM: 254940, Score: 0.728)\n- MYOPATHY, EPILEPSY, AND PROGRESSIVE CEREBRAL ATROPHY (OMIM: 619036, Score: 0.728)\n- ARTHROGRYPOSIS, DISTAL, TYPE 7 (OMIM: 158300, Score: 0.726)\n- PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 10A (ZELLWEGER) (OMIM: 614882, Score: 0.722)\n\nIII. Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Emanuel syndrome (Concept Id: C1836929) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Emanuel syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative genes: Chromosomal translocation involving 11q23 and 22q11, resulting in an unbalanced translocation (derivative chromosome 22).  \n- Inheritance pattern: Typically de novo, but can be inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation.  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Severe developmental delay and intellectual disability.  \n- Craniofacial dysmorphism: microcephaly, micrognathia, cleft or high-arched palate, ear anomalies, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds.  \n- Congenital heart defects (e.g., atrial or ventricular septal defects).  \n- Genitourinary anomalies (e.g., hypospadias, kidney malformations).  \n- Hypotonia.  \n- Failure to thrive.  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Presence of a supernumerary derivative chromosome 22 (der(22)t(11;22)) on karyotype analysis.  \n- Distinct craniofacial features, including prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, and downslanting palpebral fissures.  \n- High prevalence of congenital heart defects and genitourinary anomalies compared to other syndromes with developmental delay.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Supernumerary derivative chromosome 22 (der(22)t(11;22)).  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of hyperphagia (distinguishing it from Prader-Willi syndrome).  \n- No significant limb anomalies (distinguishing it from other chromosomal disorders like trisomy 13 or 18).  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Combination of severe developmental delay, craniofacial dysmorphism (microcephaly, cleft palate, ear anomalies), congenital heart defects, and genitourinary anomalies, along with the presence of a supernumerary derivative chromosome 22.\n- Title: Duane Syndrome in the Setting of Chromosomal Duplications |\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to create a structured summary.
