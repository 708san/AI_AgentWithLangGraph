Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Slender long bone (Concept Id: C1833144) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (WDRTS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene(s): POLR3A  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal recessive  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)  \n- Neonatal progeroid appearance (aged facial features, sparse scalp hair, prominent veins)  \n- Lipodystrophy (generalized loss of subcutaneous fat)  \n- Failure to thrive  \n- Hypotonia  \n- Intellectual disability  \n- Delayed motor development  \n- Dental anomalies (e.g., delayed eruption, hypodontia)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Neonatal onset of progeroid features, distinguishing it from other progeroid syndromes with later onset (e.g., Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome).  \n- Generalized lipodystrophy present from birth, unlike segmental or progressive lipodystrophy seen in other conditions.  \n- Prominent scalp veins and sparse hair, which are more pronounced in WDRTS compared to other syndromes with progeroid features.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Neonatal progeroid appearance with prominent scalp veins and generalized lipodystrophy.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of progressive vascular calcifications, which are seen in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.  \n- No evidence of hyperphagia, which is present in some other syndromes with failure to thrive.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The combination of neonatal progeroid features, generalized lipodystrophy, prominent scalp veins, and dental anomalies strongly suggests Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome.\n- Title: Downslanted palpebral fissures (Concept Id: C0423110) - MedGen\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Proteus syndrome (PS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative gene: *AKT1*  \n- Inheritance pattern: Sporadic, caused by a post-zygotic somatic mutation (mosaicism).  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Progressive, segmental, or patchy overgrowth of tissues.  \n- Disproportionate skeletal overgrowth (e.g., macrodactyly, limb asymmetry).  \n- Connective tissue nevi (cerebriform or plantar).  \n- Vascular malformations (capillary, venous, or lymphatic).  \n- Adipose tissue abnormalities (lipomas or lipoatrophy).  \n- Overgrowth of visceral organs (e.g., spleen, thymus).  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Progressive nature of overgrowth, which is not present at birth but becomes apparent in early childhood.  \n- Asymmetric and disproportionate overgrowth, often affecting multiple tissue types.  \n- Presence of cerebriform connective tissue nevi, which are highly characteristic.  \n- Lack of a family history due to sporadic mosaicism.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Cerebriform connective tissue nevi (pathognomonic).  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of congenital overgrowth (overgrowth develops postnatally).  \n- No intellectual disability in most cases, distinguishing it from other overgrowth syndromes with neurodevelopmental involvement.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Progressive, asymmetric overgrowth involving multiple tissue types (skeletal, adipose, vascular, and visceral) combined with cerebriform connective tissue nevi and absence of congenital overgrowth.\n- Title: Intellectual disability, mild (Concept Id: C0026106) - MedGen -\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene: *DMD* gene (encodes dystrophin protein)  \n- Inheritance Pattern: X-linked recessive  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Progressive muscle weakness, typically starting in proximal muscles (e.g., hips, thighs, shoulders)  \n- Delayed motor milestones (e.g., delayed walking)  \n- Gower’s sign (difficulty rising from the floor, using hands to \"walk up\" the legs)  \n- Calf pseudohypertrophy (enlarged calves due to fat and connective tissue replacement of muscle)  \n- Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels  \n- Cardiomyopathy and respiratory complications in later stages  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Onset typically between ages 2-5 years  \n- Rapid progression of muscle weakness compared to Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)  \n- Loss of ambulation usually by early teens  \n- More severe phenotype compared to BMD due to complete absence of dystrophin  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Complete absence of dystrophin protein on muscle biopsy or genetic testing  \n- Gower’s sign  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of intellectual disability as a primary feature (though mild cognitive impairment may occur, it is not a defining feature)  \n- No significant sensory deficits  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Early childhood onset of progressive proximal muscle weakness, delayed motor milestones, Gower’s sign, calf pseudohypertrophy, and markedly elevated CK levels, combined with X-linked inheritance and absence of dystrophin, strongly suggest DMD.\n- Title: Intellectual disability, mild (Concept Id: C0026106) - MedGen -\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene: *NF1*  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Multiple café au lait macules  \n- Intertriginous freckling (e.g., axillary or inguinal regions)  \n- Multiple cutaneous neurofibromas  \n- Learning disabilities or cognitive impairment  \n- Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas)  \n- Optic pathway gliomas  \n- Skeletal abnormalities (e.g., scoliosis, tibial dysplasia)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Presence of intertriginous freckling (highly specific for NF1 compared to other conditions with café au lait macules)  \n- Lisch nodules, which are not seen in other conditions with overlapping features  \n- Optic pathway gliomas, which are rare in other syndromes with similar skin findings  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Lisch nodules (pathognomonic for NF1)  \n- Intertriginous freckling  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of hypopigmented macules (seen in tuberous sclerosis complex)  \n- Absence of cardiac rhabdomyomas (seen in tuberous sclerosis complex)  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Combination of multiple café au lait macules, intertriginous freckling, Lisch nodules, and cutaneous neurofibromas strongly suggests NF1.\n",
