Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII. Analytical Tool Reports\n\nPubCaseFinder Report (Phenotype-based):\n- neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (Score: 0.974)\n- Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair 2 (Score: 0.969)\n- Peters plus syndrome (Score: 0.965)\n- Noonan syndrome 8 (Score: 0.951)\n- Noonan syndrome 5 (Score: 0.948)\n\nZero-Shot Diagnosis Report (Generative AI-based):\n- NOONAN SYNDROME 12; NS12 (Rank: 1)\n- CAYLER CARDIOFACIAL SYNDROME (Rank: 2)\n- COSTELLO SYNDROME; CSTLO (Rank: 3)\n- KABUKI SYNDROME 2; KABUK2 (Rank: 5)\n\nGestaltMatcher Report (Facial Dysmorphology-based):\n- Noonan syndrome (Score: 0.588)\n- Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (Score: 0.541)\n- COSTELLO SYNDROME; CSTLO (Score: 0.514)\n- SHPRINTZEN-GOLDBERG CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS SYNDROME; SGS (Score: 0.498)\n- Opitz GBBB syndrome (Score: 0.494)\n\nPhenotype Similarity Search Report (Vector-based):\n- CREE IMPAIRED INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT SYNDROME (OMIM: 606851, Score: 0.869)\n- NOONAN SYNDROME 9 (OMIM: 616559, Score: 0.844)\n- FRIAS SYNDROME (OMIM: 609640, Score: 0.840)\n- COHEN-GIBSON SYNDROME (OMIM: 617561, Score: 0.840)\n- SKIN CREASES, CONGENITAL SYMMETRIC CIRCUMFERENTIAL, 2 (OMIM: 616734, Score: 0.839)\n\nIII. Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Noonan syndrome - Wikipedia\n  Snippet: The provided text is insufficient to create a structured summary as it lacks comprehensive clinical information about the condition. Please provide a more detailed article or additional context for me to generate the requested summary.\n- Title: Webbed neck (Concept Id: C0221217) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** CHARGE Syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene(s): *CHD7*  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant (most cases are de novo mutations)  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Coloboma of the eye  \n- Heart defects (e.g., conotruncal anomalies)  \n- Choanal atresia (unilateral or bilateral)  \n- Growth retardation  \n- Developmental delay  \n- Genital hypoplasia (e.g., micropenis, cryptorchidism)  \n- Ear anomalies (e.g., malformed pinnae, hearing loss)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of coloboma, choanal atresia, and ear anomalies is highly suggestive.  \n- Inner ear malformations (e.g., hypoplastic semicircular canals) are a distinguishing feature on imaging.  \n- Unilateral or bilateral choanal atresia is more specific to CHARGE compared to other syndromes with overlapping features.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Hypoplastic or absent semicircular canals on imaging.  \n- Coloboma with choanal atresia.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of polydactyly (helps differentiate from conditions like Pallister-Hall syndrome).  \n- Absence of hyperphagia (distinguishes from Prader-Willi syndrome).  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The triad of coloboma, choanal atresia, and characteristic ear anomalies (including hearing loss) strongly points to CHARGE syndrome, especially when combined with semicircular canal hypoplasia and genital hypoplasia.\n",
