Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Hereditary disorders of connective tissue: A guide to the\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Marfan syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative gene: *FBN1* (fibrillin-1)  \n- Inheritance pattern: Autosomal dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Tall stature with disproportionately long limbs (dolichostenomelia)  \n- Arachnodactyly (long, slender fingers)  \n- Pectus deformities (pectus excavatum or carinatum)  \n- Scoliosis or kyphosis  \n- Joint hypermobility  \n- Ectopia lentis (dislocation of the lens)  \n- Myopia  \n- Aortic root dilation, leading to risk of aortic dissection or rupture  \n- Mitral valve prolapse  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Ectopia lentis is a key ocular finding that is uncommon in other connective tissue disorders.  \n- Aortic root dilation is a hallmark cardiovascular feature, often absent in other syndromes with overlapping skeletal features.  \n- Absence of significant skin findings (e.g., no atrophic scars or easy bruising, which are seen in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Ectopia lentis  \n- Aortic root dilation  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of significant skin fragility or atrophic scarring (distinguishes from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).  \n- Absence of intellectual disability (distinguishes from homocystinuria).  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Combination of tall stature, arachnodactyly, ectopia lentis, and aortic root dilation strongly suggests Marfan syndrome.\n- Title: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (Concept Id: C4551649) -\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to create a structured summary.
