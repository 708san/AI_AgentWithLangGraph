Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII. Analytical Tool Reports\n\nPubCaseFinder Report (Phenotype-based):\n- branchiooculofacial syndrome (Score: 1.000)\n- Fontaine progeroid syndrome (Score: 0.830)\n- Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (Score: 0.817)\n- CHARGE syndrome (Score: 0.806)\n- Baraitser-Winter syndrome 1 (Score: 0.795)\n\nZero-Shot Diagnosis Report (Generative AI-based):\n- CHARGE SYNDROME (Rank: 1)\n- BRANCHIOOTORENAL SYNDROME 1; BOR1 (Rank: 2)\n- KABUKI SYNDROME 2; KABUK2 (Rank: 3)\n- TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME 2; TCS2 (Rank: 4)\n- WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2A; WS2A (Rank: 5)\n\nGestaltMatcher Report (Facial Dysmorphology-based):\n- BRANCHIOOCULOFACIAL SYNDROME; BOFS (Score: 0.548)\n- SMITH-LEMLI-OPITZ SYNDROME; SLOS (Score: 0.498)\n- Linear skin defects with multiple congenital anomalies (Score: 0.498)\n- OKUR-CHUNG NEURODEVELOPMENTAL SYNDROME; OCNDS (Score: 0.486)\n- ARBOLEDA-THAM SYNDROME; ARTHS (Score: 0.482)\n\nPhenotype Similarity Search Report (Vector-based):\n- WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 1 (OMIM: 193500, Score: 0.812)\n- TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME 1 (OMIM: 154500, Score: 0.810)\n- SHORT STATURE, HEARING LOSS, RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA, AND DISTINCTIVE FACIES (OMIM: 617763, Score: 0.808)\n- BRANCHIOOCULOFACIAL SYNDROME (OMIM: 113620, Score: 0.807)\n- BRANCHIAL ARCH ABNORMALITIES, CHOANAL ATRESIA, ATHELIA, HEARING LOSS, AND HYPOTHYROIDISM SYNDROME (OMIM: 620186, Score: 0.802)\n\nIII. Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Premature birth (Concept Id: C0151526) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Gitelman syndrome (GS)\n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative gene(s): *SLC12A3* (encoding the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter, NCC)  \n- Inheritance pattern: Autosomal recessive  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)  \n- Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels)  \n- Hypocalciuria (low urinary calcium excretion)  \n- Metabolic alkalosis (elevated blood pH)  \n- Muscle cramps, fatigue, and weakness  \n- Salt craving  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Hypocalciuria: Unlike Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome is characterized by low urinary calcium excretion.  \n- Hypomagnesemia: More pronounced in Gitelman syndrome compared to Bartter syndrome.  \n- Absence of polyhydramnios or neonatal symptoms: Gitelman syndrome typically presents later in life, often in adolescence or adulthood, unlike some forms of Bartter syndrome that present neonatally.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Combination of hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria with metabolic alkalosis.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of hypercalciuria (present in some forms of Bartter syndrome).  \n- Absence of significant growth retardation or failure to thrive in infancy (common in Bartter syndrome).  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The triad of hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria, along with metabolic alkalosis, is highly suggestive of Gitelman syndrome and helps distinguish it from Bartter syndrome and other renal tubular disorders.\n",
