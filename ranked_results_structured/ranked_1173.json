Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2.
