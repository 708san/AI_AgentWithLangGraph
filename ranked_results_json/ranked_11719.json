Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Nabais Sa-de Vries syndrome, type 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:618828  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to its top score (0.843) in the phenotype similarity search report, which strongly aligns with the patient's neurodevelopmental delay, dysmorphic facial features, and growth retardation. The syndrome's phenotype overlaps significantly with the patient's clinical presentation, as supported by vector-based analysis [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Warsaw breakage syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:613398  \nDescription: Warsaw breakage syndrome is ranked second due to its high score (0.835) in the phenotype similarity search report. The patient's features, including developmental delay and dysmorphic facies, are consistent with the syndrome's known phenotype. The strong evidence from phenotype matching supports this diagnosis [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder with speech delay and dysmorphic facies  \nOMIM: OMIM:618506  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a high score (0.834) in the phenotype similarity search report. The patient's speech delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features align well with the clinical description of this disorder. The phenotype similarity tool provides strong evidence for this match [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Growth retardation, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphism  \nOMIM: OMIM:612938  \nDescription: This disorder is ranked fourth due to its high score (0.834) in the phenotype similarity search report. The patient's growth retardation, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphism are consistent with the syndrome's phenotype. The evidence from phenotype matching supports this diagnosis [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Li-Ghorbani-Weisz-Hubshman syndrome  \nOMIM: Not available  \nDescription: This syndrome is ranked fifth based on its top score (0.828) in the PubCaseFinder report. The patient's neurodevelopmental delay and dysmorphic features align with the syndrome's phenotype. The PubCaseFinder tool provides strong evidence for this match [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Chromosome 18q deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: Not available  \nDescription: Chromosome 18q deletion syndrome is ranked sixth due to its high score (0.814) in the PubCaseFinder report.
