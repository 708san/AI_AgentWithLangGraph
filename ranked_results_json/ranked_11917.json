Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:135900  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to its consistent ranking across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.932), GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.537), and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.898). The patient's phenotype, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, and facial dysmorphology, aligns strongly with Coffin-Siris syndrome [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome 5  \nOMIM: OMIM:616938  \nDescription: Coffin-Siris syndrome 5 is supported by high scores in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.908) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.889). The overlap in clinical features, such as intellectual disability and coarse facial features, further strengthens this diagnosis [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is plausible based on its high PubCaseFinder score (0.862) and its presence in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report (Rank: 4). The patient's broad thumbs, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphology are hallmark features of this syndrome [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 is ranked highly in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report (Rank: 1) and has a strong PubCaseFinder score (0.835). The patient’s synophrys, developmental delay, and limb abnormalities are characteristic of this syndrome [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is ranked second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, suggesting moderate plausibility. The patient’s facial dysmorphology, developmental delay, and hypotonia align with Kabuki syndrome features [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:615009  \nDescription: Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.535). The patient’s intellectual disability and facial dysmorphology are consistent with this diagnosis, though evidence is less robust compared to higher-ranked candidates [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:605130  \nDescription: Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome is plausible based on GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.479). The patient’s hypertrichosis, developmental delay, and coarse facial features are characteristic of this syndrome [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with motor abnormalities, seizures, and facial dysmorphisms  \nOMIM: OMIM:620719  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.881). The patient’s seizures, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphology align with this disorder, though it is less frequently identified across tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Filippi syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:272440  \nDescription: Filippi syndrome is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.879). The patient’s syndactyly, microcephaly, and intellectual disability are consistent with this diagnosis, though evidence is limited compared to higher-ranked candidates [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Crouzon syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:123500  \nDescription: Crouzon syndrome is supported by literature findings, particularly the presence of craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, and proptosis. The absence of syndactyly and normal intelligence further distinguish this diagnosis [3].  \n\n"
