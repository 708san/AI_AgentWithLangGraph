  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Costello syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:218040  \nDescription: Costello syndrome is consistently ranked highly across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.976) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.532). The phenotype of intellectual disability, feeding difficulties, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphology aligns strongly with the patient's presentation [1], [2]. Additionally, literature supports the presence of webbed neck and hypotonia, which are characteristic features of this syndrome [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 8  \nOMIM: OMIM:615355  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome 8 is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.915) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.853). The patient's features of webbed neck, developmental delay, and hypotonia are consistent with this diagnosis [1], [4]. The overlap in facial dysmorphology and cardiac anomalies further strengthens the plausibility of this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:115150  \nDescription: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is ranked highly in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.925) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.455). The patient's phenotype of intellectual disability, feeding difficulties, and facial dysmorphology aligns with this diagnosis [1], [2]. Additionally, cardiac anomalies and skin abnormalities reported in the literature are consistent with this syndrome [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:617506  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.918) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.462). The patient's features of developmental delay, hypotonia, and loose anagen hair are characteristic of this disorder [1], [2]. The overlap with Noonan syndrome phenotypes further supports its plausibility [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 12  \nOMIM: OMIM:618499  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome 12 is ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and shares significant phenotypic overlap with other Noonan syndrome subtypes. The patient's webbed neck, developmental delay, and cardiac anomalies are consistent with this diagnosis [1], [4]. However, it is ranked lower due to less consensus across tools compared to other Noonan subtypes.  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and has some phenotypic overlap with the patient's presentation, including developmental delay and facial dysmorphology [1], [2]. However, it is ranked lower due to weaker evidence and lack of consensus across tools.  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:601321  \nDescription: Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.894). The patient's features of developmental delay and hypotonia align with this diagnosis [1], [2]. However, it is ranked lower due to limited evidence and weaker phenotypic overlap compared to other candidates.  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Kosaki overgrowth syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:616592  \nDescription: Kosaki overgrowth syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.462). While the patient's developmental delay and dysmorphic features may overlap, the evidence is weaker compared to other diagnoses [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Cree impaired intellectual development syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:606851  \nDescription: Cree impaired intellectual development syndrome is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.851). The patient's intellectual disability and developmental delay align with this diagnosis [4]. However, it is ranked lower due to limited consensus across tools and weaker phenotypic overlap.  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Cayler cardiofacial syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:225020  \nDescription: Cayler cardiofacial syndrome is ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. While cardiac anomalies and facial dysmorphology may overlap with the patient's presentation, the evidence is weaker compared to other candidates [1], [2].  \n\n"
