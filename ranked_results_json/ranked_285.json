Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:122470  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (highest score: 0.978) and GestaltMatcher (facial dysmorphology match: 0.652). The patient's phenotype of growth retardation, intellectual disability, and characteristic facial features aligns closely with the clinical presentation of Cornelia de Lange syndrome [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 is ranked highly by Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.839). The overlap in phenotypic features, including delayed growth, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features, further supports this diagnosis [3], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.904) and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 2).
