Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to strong consensus across multiple tools, including Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1) and PubCaseFinder (high scores for Cornelia de Lange subtypes, including CDLS2). The patient's phenotype aligns with hallmark features of Cornelia de Lange syndrome, such as facial dysmorphology, developmental delay, and limb abnormalities [1], [2]. GestaltMatcher also supports this diagnosis with a notable facial similarity score [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is supported by high scores in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.907) and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 3). The patient’s phenotype, including intellectual disability, hypotonia, and characteristic facial features, aligns with Kabuki syndrome [1], [2]. While not the top-ranked diagnosis, the evidence from multiple tools strengthens its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Peters plus syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:261540  \nDescription: Peters plus syndrome is ranked highly in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.939), suggesting strong phenotype overlap. The patient’s features, including short stature, developmental delay, and possible ocular anomalies, are consistent with this diagnosis [1]. However, it lacks consensus across other tools, slightly lowering its rank [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:613684  \nDescription: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 2 is ranked second in Zero-Shot Diagnosis, indicating significant phenotypic overlap. Features such as broad thumbs, intellectual disability, and characteristic facial dysmorphology support this diagnosis [1]. However, it is not highlighted in other tools, reducing its overall plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Silver-Russell syndrome 3  \nOMIM: OMIM:616489  \nDescription: Silver-Russell syndrome 3 is supported by a high score in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.810). The patient’s short stature, growth retardation, and possible facial features align with this diagnosis [1]. However, it is not corroborated by other tools, limiting its rank [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 12  \nOMIM: OMIM:616559  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome 12 is ranked fourth in Zero-Shot Diagnosis, suggesting phenotypic overlap. Features such as short stature, congenital heart defects, and facial dysmorphology are consistent with Noonan syndrome [1]. However, it is not supported by other tools, lowering its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Insulin-like growth factor I deficiency  \nOMIM: OMIM:608747  \nDescription: Insulin-like growth factor I deficiency is supported by a high score in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.804). The patient’s growth retardation and possible endocrine abnormalities align with this diagnosis [1]. However, it lacks consensus across other tools, reducing its rank [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Meier-Gorlin syndrome 5  \nOMIM: OMIM:613805  \nDescription: Meier-Gorlin syndrome 5 is supported by a notable score in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.789). Features such as short stature, microtia, and developmental delay are consistent with this diagnosis [1]. However, it is not corroborated by other tools, limiting its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Miller syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:263750  \nDescription: Miller syndrome is supported by a high score in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.788). The patient’s craniofacial anomalies and limb abnormalities align with this diagnosis [1]. However, it lacks consensus across other tools, reducing its rank [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Alagille syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:118450  \nDescription: Alagille syndrome 1 is ranked fifth in Zero-Shot Diagnosis, suggesting phenotypic overlap. Features such as cholestasis, cardiac anomalies, and characteristic facial features are consistent with this diagnosis [1]. However, it is not highlighted in other tools, lowering its plausibility [2].  \n\n"
