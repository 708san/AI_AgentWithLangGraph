  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Treacher Collins syndrome 2 (TCS2)  \nOMIM: OMIM:613717  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to the strong consensus across multiple tools, including its top rank in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report and high score in GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.509). The patient's phenotype of mandibulofacial dysostosis, microcephaly, and hearing impairment aligns with the clinical features of TCS2 [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Postaxial acrofacial dysostosis  \nOMIM: OMIM:263750  \nDescription: This condition is supported by the PubCaseFinder report, where it received the highest possible score (1.000). The patient's dysostosis and craniofacial abnormalities are consistent with the phenotype described for this disorder [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Mandibulofacial dysostosis-microcephaly syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:610536  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the PubCaseFinder report (Score: 1.000) and overlaps with the patient's craniofacial dysmorphology and microcephaly. The phenotype similarity search also identified related mandibulofacial dysostosis conditions, further strengthening the plausibility [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Acrofacial dysostosis 1, Nager type (AFD1)  \nOMIM: OMIM:154400  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified this condition with a moderate score (0.576), and it aligns with the patient's craniofacial dysostosis and limb abnormalities. While not ranked as highly as other conditions, the phenotype overlap makes it a plausible candidate [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, musculocontractural type 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:601776  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder ranked this condition with a perfect score (1.000), suggesting strong phenotype alignment. The patient's hypotonia and joint hypermobility are consistent with this diagnosis, though it is less supported by other tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome was ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report, and the presence of hearing impairment and craniofacial abnormalities in the patient supports this diagnosis. However, it lacks strong consensus across other tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Maxillofacial dysostosis  \nOMIM: OMIM:155000  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identified this condition with a high score (0.808). The patient's craniofacial dysmorphology aligns with the features of maxillofacial dysostosis, though it is not prioritized by other tools [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Diamond-Blackfan anemia 15 with mandibulofacial dysostosis  \nOMIM: OMIM:606164  \nDescription: This condition was identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search with a high score (0.804). The combination of anemia and craniofacial dysostosis matches some of the patient's features, but it is less supported by other tools [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: FG syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:305450  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder ranked this condition with a perfect score (1.000). The patient's developmental delay and hypotonia are consistent with FG syndrome 1, though it lacks support from other tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Deafness, congenital, with inner ear agenesis, microtia, and microdontia  \nOMIM: OMIM:610706  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identified this condition with a high score (0.797). The patient's hearing impairment and craniofacial abnormalities align with this diagnosis, but it is not prioritized by other tools [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Cerebrocostomandibular syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:117650  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified this condition with a moderate score (0.428). The patient's craniofacial dysmorphology and skeletal abnormalities align with this diagnosis, though it is less supported by other tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Townes-Brocks syndrome 1 (TBS1)  \nOMIM: OMIM:107480  \nDescription: Ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report, this condition is supported by the presence of hearing impairment and limb abnormalities. However, it lacks strong consensus across other tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Braddock-Carey syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:619981  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identified this condition with a moderate score (0.794). The patient's craniofacial dysmorphology aligns with this diagnosis, but it is less supported by other tools [3].  \n\n"
