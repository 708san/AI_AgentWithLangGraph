Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:135900  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to its strong phenotype match across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.837). The patient’s features of developmental delay, coarse facial features, and hypotonia align well with the syndrome’s clinical presentation [1]. Additionally, Coffin-Siris syndrome is frequently identified in cases with overlapping neurodevelopmental and dysmorphic features [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Adams-Oliver syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:614219  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the high score (0.845) in the Phenotype Similarity Search report. The syndrome is characterized by limb anomalies and scalp defects, which may overlap with the patient’s reported dysmorphic features. The strong phenotype similarity suggests a close match [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 48  \nOMIM: OMIM:617751  \nDescription: This disorder is ranked highly due to its strong score (0.839) in the Phenotype Similarity Search report. The patient’s intellectual disability and dysmorphic features are consistent with the clinical presentation of this disorder [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Intellectual disability, X-linked 99, syndromic, female-restricted  \nOMIM: OMIM:300909  \nDescription: This diagnosis is plausible based on the PubCaseFinder score (0.813). The patient’s neurodevelopmental delay and dysmorphic features align with the syndrome’s phenotype, particularly in female patients [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Koolen-de Vries syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:610443  \nDescription: This syndrome is supported by a PubCaseFinder score of 0.795. The patient’s developmental delay and hypotonia are hallmark features of Koolen-de Vries syndrome, which is caused by a microdeletion or mutation in the KANSL1 gene [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 7  \nOMIM: OMIM:615547  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified this disorder with a score of 0.565, suggesting a moderate match based on facial dysmorphology. The patient’s intellectual disability and dysmorphic features are consistent with the syndrome’s phenotype [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:605130  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.465). The patient’s coarse facial features and developmental delay are consistent with Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the KMT2A gene [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder with microcephaly and pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia  \nOMIM: OMIM:300749  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identified this disorder with a score of 0.835. The patient’s intellectual disability and potential brain anomalies align with the syndrome’s clinical presentation [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Bohring-Opitz syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:605039  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder identified this syndrome with a score of 0.787. The patient’s severe developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features are consistent with Bohring-Opitz syndrome, which is characterized by distinctive craniofacial features and profound neurodevelopmental impairment [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with or without anomalies of the brain, eye, or heart  \nOMIM: OMIM:619000  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder identified this disorder with a score of 0.782. The patient’s neurodevelopmental delay and potential organ anomalies align with the broad phenotype of this disorder [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Joubert syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:213300  \nDescription: Zero-Shot Diagnosis ranked this syndrome at position 5. The patient’s developmental delay and potential cerebellar involvement are consistent with Joubert syndrome, which is characterized by the molar tooth sign on brain imaging and neurodevelopmental impairment [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Asparagine synthetase deficiency  \nOMIM: OMIM:615574  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identified this disorder with a score of 0.836. The patient’s neurodevelopmental delay and potential metabolic anomalies align with the syndrome’s phenotype [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Kury-Isidor syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:619762  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identified this disorder with a score of 0.835. The patient’s dysmorphic features and developmental delay are consistent with the syndrome’s clinical presentation [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Hydrolethalus syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:614121  \nDescription: Zero-Shot Diagnosis ranked this syndrome at position 3. While the patient’s phenotype partially overlaps with the severe developmental anomalies seen in Hydrolethalus syndrome, the lack of specific hallmark features reduces its plausibility [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: Mowat-Wilson syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:235730  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified this syndrome with a score of 0.452. The patient’s developmental delay and dysmorphic features are consistent with Mowat-Wilson syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the ZEB2 gene [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 16  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies, seizures, and distal limb anomalies  \nOMIM: OMIM:618367  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified this disorder with a score of 0.453. The patient’s dysmorphic features and developmental delay align with the syndrome’s phenotype, though seizures were not reported [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 17  \nDisease: Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:190350  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified this syndrome with a score of 0.457. The patient’s dysmorphic features, including potential craniofacial anomalies, align with the syndrome’s phenotype, though limb involvement was not noted [4].  "
