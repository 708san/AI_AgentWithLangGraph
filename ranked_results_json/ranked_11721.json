Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Facial-Limb Defects as Major Feature | Obgyn Key\n  Snippet: The provided text appears to be medically related. Below is the structured summary based on the provided content:\n\n---\n\n**Disease:** Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS)\n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene(s): *TCOF1*, *POLR1C*, *POLR1D*  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant (most common), autosomal recessive (rare, associated with *POLR1C*)  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Downslanting palpebral fissures  \n- Colobomata of the eyelids  \n- Ectropion (outward turning of the eyelid)  \n- Sparse eyebrows  \n- Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bones and mandible  \n- Microtia or anotia (underdeveloped or absent external ears)  \n- Conductive hearing loss  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Vertical bony cleft visible on radiologic imaging  \n- Bilateral and symmetric craniofacial abnormalities  \n- Normal intelligence (distinguishing it from syndromes with intellectual disability)  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Downslanting palpebral fissures with eyelid colobomata and zygomatic hypoplasia  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of intellectual disability  \n- No limb abnormalities (distinguishing it from syndromes like Nager syndrome)  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Combination of downslanting palpebral fissures, eyelid colobomata, zygomatic and mandibular hypoplasia, and normal cognitive development strongly suggests Treacher Collins Syndrome.  \n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or additional details!\n",
