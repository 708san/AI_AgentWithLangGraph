Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:122470  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to its consistent ranking across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (highest score: 0.905) and GestaltMatcher (facial dysmorphology match: 0.648). The patient’s phenotype, including developmental delay and dysmorphic facial features, aligns strongly with the clinical presentation of Cornelia de Lange syndrome [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 5  \nOMIM: OMIM:300882  \nDescription: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 5 is supported by PubCaseFinder (score: 0.904) and shares overlapping phenotypic features with Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1, including intellectual disability and characteristic facial dysmorphology. While slightly less supported than Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1, it remains a strong candidate [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is ranked second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features, which overlap with the patient’s phenotype. Although not identified in other tools, its high rank in one report warrants consideration [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Peters plus syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:261540  \nDescription: Peters plus syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (score: 0.897). The syndrome is characterized by anterior eye segment dysgenesis, short stature, and developmental delay, which partially overlap with the patient’s phenotype. However, it is less consistently ranked across tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:614608  \nDescription: Coffin-Siris syndrome 2 is supported by both Zero-Shot Diagnosis (rank: 4) and GestaltMatcher (score: 0.469). The syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, coarse facial features, and hypotonia, which align with the patient’s clinical presentation. However, its lower scores reduce its plausibility compared to higher-ranked candidates [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome is ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. It is characterized by coloboma, heart defects, and developmental delay. While some features overlap with the patient’s phenotype, it is less strongly supported by other tools [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Meier-Gorlin syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:613800  \nDescription: Meier-Gorlin syndrome 2 is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (score: 0.835). It is characterized by short stature, microtia, and developmental delay. While the phenotype partially overlaps, it is not consistently ranked across other tools, reducing its plausibility [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:613684  \nDescription: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 2 is ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. It is characterized by intellectual disability, broad thumbs, and distinctive facial features. While some features overlap, it is not supported by other tools, reducing its overall plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Branchiooculofacial syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:113620  \nDescription: Branchiooculofacial syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (score: 0.880). It is characterized by branchial clefts, ocular anomalies, and facial dysmorphology. While some features overlap, it is less consistently ranked across tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Mucopolysaccharidoses  \nOMIM: Various  \nDescription: Mucopolysaccharidoses is identified in GestaltMatcher (score: 0.476). It is characterized by coarse facial features, developmental delay, and organomegaly. While some features overlap, the lack of consensus across tools reduces its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Kapur-Toriello syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:244300  \nDescription: Kapur-Toriello syndrome is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (score: 0.814). It is characterized by developmental delay and dysmorphic features. However, it is not supported by other tools, reducing its plausibility [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Chromosome 20q11-q12 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:614257  \nDescription: Chromosome 20q11-q12 deletion syndrome is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (score: 0.800). It is characterized by developmental delay and dysmorphic features. However, it is not supported by other tools, reducing its plausibility [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Blepharophimosis with facial and genital anomalies and impaired intellectual development  \nOMIM: OMIM:604314  \nDescription: This syndrome is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (score: 0.804). It is characterized by blepharophimosis, genital anomalies, and intellectual disability. While some features overlap, it is not supported by other tools, reducing its plausibility [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:613720  \nDescription: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 2 is identified in GestaltMatcher (score: 0.472). It is characterized by severe developmental delay and epilepsy. While some features overlap, it is not supported by other tools, reducing its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: Meier-Gorlin syndrome 6  \nOMIM: OMIM:616835  \nDescription: Meier-Gorlin syndrome 6 is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (score: 0.800). It is characterized by short stature, microtia, and developmental delay. However, it is not supported by other tools, reducing its plausibility [4].  "
