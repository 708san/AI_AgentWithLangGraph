Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Postnatal growth retardation (Concept Id: C1859778) - MedGen -\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nDubowitz syndrome (DS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \nThe causative gene(s) and inheritance pattern are currently unknown, though some cases suggest autosomal recessive inheritance.  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Prenatal and postnatal growth retardation  \n- Microcephaly  \n- Distinctive facial features (e.g., triangular face, broad nasal bridge, telecanthus, thin upper lip)  \n- Eczema or other skin abnormalities  \n- Mild to moderate intellectual disability  \n- Behavioral abnormalities (e.g., hyperactivity, social anxiety)  \n- Immunodeficiency or recurrent infections  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of growth retardation with microcephaly and characteristic facial dysmorphism  \n- Presence of eczema or other skin findings, which are less common in other syndromes with overlapping features  \n- Behavioral abnormalities, particularly social anxiety, which may help distinguish it from other syndromes with intellectual disability  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Distinctive facial features, including triangular face, broad nasal bridge, and telecanthus  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of major organ malformations (e.g., cardiac or renal anomalies), which are often seen in other syndromes with growth retardation and microcephaly  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \nThe combination of prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, distinctive facial features (triangular face, broad nasal bridge, telecanthus), eczema, and behavioral abnormalities (e.g., social anxiety) strongly suggests Dubowitz syndrome.\n- Title: Long philtrum (Concept Id: C1865014) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to create a structured summary.
