Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Phelan-McDermid syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:606232  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the high consensus across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.943) and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 3). The patient's phenotype of global developmental delay, hypotonia, and speech impairment aligns closely with the hallmark features of this syndrome [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: chromosome 15q24 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:615656  \nDescription: This diagnosis is plausible based on the high score in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.906) and the overlap of neurodevelopmental delay and dysmorphic features observed in the patient. The deletion syndrome is known for its association with intellectual disability and characteristic facial features, which match the phenotype similarity search findings [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: The patient's dysmorphic features, developmental delay, and behavioral abnormalities are consistent with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which scored highly in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.889). The syndrome is characterized by broad thumbs, facial dysmorphology, and intellectual disability, which align with the phenotype data [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Koolen-de Vries syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:610443  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.865) and the patient's phenotype of developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features. Koolen-de Vries syndrome is caused by KANSL1 haploinsufficiency and is associated with similar clinical findings [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Sotos syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:117550  \nDescription: Sotos syndrome was ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and is characterized by macrocephaly, developmental delay, and overgrowth. The patient's macrocephaly and developmental delay are consistent with this diagnosis, although it was not highlighted in other tools, reducing its overall plausibility [2], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Smith-Magenis syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:182290  \nDescription: Smith-Magenis syndrome was ranked second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and is associated with intellectual disability, sleep disturbances, and behavioral abnormalities. While the behavioral phenotype aligns with the patient's findings, the lack of consensus across other tools lowers its ranking [2], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 was ranked fourth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and distinctive facial features. While the dysmorphic features overlap with the patient's phenotype, the lack of strong evidence from other tools reduces its plausibility [2], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome was ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and is associated with coloboma, heart defects, and developmental delay. While some features overlap, the absence of hallmark findings such as coloboma or heart defects in the patient makes this diagnosis less likely [2], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Beck-Fahrner syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:618798  \nDescription: Beck-Fahrner syndrome was identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.822) and is associated with developmental delay, behavioral abnormalities, and dysmorphic features. The patient's phenotype partially overlaps, but the lower score compared to other candidates reduces its ranking [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked 93  \nOMIM: OMIM:300659  \nDescription: This disorder was identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.824) and is associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability. While the phenotype overlaps, the lack of consensus across tools limits its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with speech impairment and dysmorphic facies  \nOMIM: OMIM:617268  \nDescription: This diagnosis was highlighted in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.869) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.810). The patient's speech impairment and dysmorphic features align with this disorder, but the lower scores compared to other candidates reduce its ranking [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:135900  \nDescription: Coffin-Siris syndrome was identified in GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.438) and is associated with developmental delay, coarse facial features, and behavioral abnormalities. While the phenotype overlaps, the low score and lack of consensus across tools limit its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 50, with behavioral abnormalities  \nOMIM: OMIM:617824  \nDescription: This disorder was identified in GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.454) and is associated with developmental delay and behavioral abnormalities. The patient's phenotype partially overlaps, but the low score and lack of consensus reduce its ranking [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Developmental delay, behavioral abnormalities, and neuropsychiatric disorders  \nOMIM: OMIM:620065  \nDescription: This disorder was identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.814) and is associated with developmental delay and behavioral abnormalities. While the phenotype overlaps, the lower score and lack of consensus across tools limit its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 56  \nOMIM: OMIM:618382  \nDescription: This disorder was identified in GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.438) and is associated with developmental delay and dysmorphic features. The patient's phenotype partially overlaps, but the low score and lack of consensus reduce its ranking [3].  \n\n"
