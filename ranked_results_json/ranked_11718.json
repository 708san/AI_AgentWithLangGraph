  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's global developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features, which align with the hallmark phenotypes of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome [1]. The high PubCaseFinder score (0.790) further strengthens the plausibility of this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is highly plausible due to the patient's dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay, which are consistent with the phenotype described in Kabuki syndrome [3]. The Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool ranked this as the top candidate, and its overlap with global developmental delay supports this diagnosis [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:135900  \nDescription: Coffin-Siris syndrome is supported by dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay, which match the patient's phenotype. GestaltMatcher identified Coffin-Siris syndrome with a score of 0.525, and it was ranked second by the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:194190  \nDescription: The patient's dysmorphic facial features, hypotonia, and developmental delay are consistent with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. PubCaseFinder provided a high score (0.772), indicating strong phenotype overlap [6].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:264090  \nDescription: This diagnosis is plausible due to the presence of dysmorphic facial features and hypotonia, which align with Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome. PubCaseFinder identified this syndrome with a score of 0.770, suggesting significant phenotype similarity [7].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Marshall-Smith syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:602535  \nDescription: Marshall-Smith syndrome is supported by the patient's dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay. The Phenotype Similarity Search tool provided a high score (0.815), indicating strong evidence for this diagnosis [8].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Van Maldergem syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:601390  \nDescription: The patient's dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay are consistent with Van Maldergem syndrome 1. The Phenotype Similarity Search tool provided a high score (0.812), supporting this diagnosis [9].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia and dysmorphic facies (NEDHYDF)  \nOMIM: [Not available]  \nDescription: This diagnosis is plausible based on the patient's global developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features, which align with the limited description of NEDHYDF in the literature [10]. However, the lack of detailed genetic information limits the strength of this diagnosis.  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome is supported by the presence of dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay. The Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool ranked this as the fourth most likely candidate, but the absence of hallmark features such as coloboma or heart defects weakens the plausibility [11].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:270400  \nDescription: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is plausible due to the presence of developmental delay and dysmorphic features. However, the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool ranked this fifth, and no additional evidence from other tools supports this diagnosis [12].  \n\n"
