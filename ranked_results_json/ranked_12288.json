Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 (CDLS2)  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to consensus across multiple tools. It ranks first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report and is supported by GestaltMatcher with a high facial dysmorphology similarity score (0.488). The patient’s phenotype, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, and distinctive facial features, aligns strongly with the clinical presentation of Cornelia de Lange syndrome [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Intellectual disability, autosomal dominant 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:615828  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a high phenotype similarity score (0.789) in PubCaseFinder. The patient’s intellectual disability and developmental delay are hallmark features of this condition. The autosomal dominant inheritance pattern may also align with family history if available [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to EP300 haploinsufficiency  \nOMIM: OMIM:613684  \nDescription: This diagnosis is plausible based on a strong PubCaseFinder score (0.775). The patient’s developmental delay, intellectual disability, and potential dysmorphic features are consistent with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. EP300 haploinsufficiency is a known genetic cause of this condition [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Floating-Harbor syndrome (FLHS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:136140  \nDescription: This diagnosis ranks second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report, indicating strong generative AI-based evidence. The patient’s phenotype, including developmental delay and distinctive facial features, overlaps significantly with Floating-Harbor syndrome [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Microcephaly, developmental delay, and brittle hair syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:617758  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a PubCaseFinder score of 0.773. The patient’s microcephaly, developmental delay, and potential hair abnormalities align with the clinical presentation of this syndrome [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Sotos syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:117550  \nDescription: Sotos syndrome ranks fourth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report, suggesting moderate plausibility.
