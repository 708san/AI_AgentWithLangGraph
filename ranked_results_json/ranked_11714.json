Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies, seizures, and distal limb anomalies  \nOMIM: OMIM:617452  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.747) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.834), indicating significant overlap with the patient's phenotype. The presence of dysmorphic facial features, seizures, and distal limb anomalies aligns closely with the reported symptoms [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome is ranked highly by the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool (Rank: 1) and is consistent with the patient's phenotype, particularly coloboma, heart defects, and craniofacial anomalies. These features are hallmark signs of CHARGE syndrome, making it a plausible diagnosis [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:147920  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 1 is ranked second by the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool and is supported by the patient's dysmorphic facial features, developmental delay, and hypotonia. These findings are characteristic of Kabuki syndrome, further strengthening its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Williams-Beuren region duplication syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:609757  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the Phenotype Similarity Search tool (Score: 0.847), which highlights significant overlap with the patient's phenotype, including craniofacial dysmorphism and neurodevelopmental delay. The high score suggests strong evidence for this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with cataracts, poor growth, and dysmorphic facies  \nOMIM: OMIM:618571  \nDescription: This diagnosis is ranked highly by the Phenotype Similarity Search tool (Score: 0.845). The patient's dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay align with the reported phenotype, making this a plausible candidate [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Autosomal dominant intellectual disability-craniofacial anomalies-cardiac defects syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM: Not available  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder ranks this diagnosis highest (Score: 0.812), suggesting significant overlap with the patient's intellectual disability, craniofacial anomalies, and cardiac defects. However, the lack of OMIM ID limits further validation [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Myhre syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:139210  \nDescription: Myhre syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.757), which highlights craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay as key features. While plausible, it is ranked lower due to less consensus across tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Phelan-McDermid syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:606232  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder identifies this syndrome with a score of 0.755, citing intellectual disability and dysmorphic features as overlapping with the patient's phenotype. However, it is ranked lower due to limited support from other tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Craniofacial dysmorphism, skeletal anomalies, and impaired intellectual development 1  \nOMIM: OMIM: Not available  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder ranks this diagnosis with a score of 0.745, suggesting overlap with the patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay. However, the absence of an OMIM ID and limited consensus reduce its plausibility [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:163950  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome 1 is ranked third by the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, supported by features such as craniofacial anomalies and developmental delay. However, it is ranked lower due to less specific overlap with the patient's phenotype [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Cohen syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:216550  \nDescription: Cohen syndrome is ranked fourth by the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, supported by dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay. However, it is ranked lower due to limited evidence from other tools [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Alagille syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:118450  \nDescription: Alagille syndrome 1 is ranked fifth by the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, supported by features such as heart defects and facial dysmorphism. However, it is ranked lower due to limited overlap with the patient's phenotype [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Verheij syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:615583  \nDescription: Verheij syndrome is identified by the Phenotype Similarity Search tool (Score: 0.833), citing craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay. However, it is ranked lower due to less consensus across tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Menke-Hennekam syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM: Not available  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identifies this syndrome (Score: 0.479), citing craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay. However, it is ranked lower due to limited evidence and lack of OMIM ID [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: You-Hoover-Fong syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM: Not available  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identifies this syndrome (Score: 0.505), citing craniofacial dysmorphism. However, it is ranked lower due to limited evidence and lack of OMIM ID [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 16  \nDisease: Pierpont syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM: Not available  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identifies this syndrome (Score: 0.503), citing craniofacial dysmorphism. However, it is ranked lower due to limited evidence and lack of OMIM ID [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 17  \nDisease: Microphthalmia, syndromic  \nOMIM: OMIM: Not available  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identifies this syndrome (Score: 0.474), citing craniofacial dysmorphism. However, it is ranked lower due to limited evidence and lack of OMIM ID [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 18  \nDisease: Sifrim-Hitz-Weiss syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM: Not available  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identifies this syndrome (Score: 0.461), citing craniofacial dysmorphism.
