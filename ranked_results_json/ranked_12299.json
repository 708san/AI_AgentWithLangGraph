  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Rett syndrome, congenital variant  \nOMIM: OMIM:312750  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to its strong consensus across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.957) and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 2). The patient's neurodevelopmental regression, absent language development, and seizure activity align closely with the phenotype of Rett syndrome [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: chromosome 15q24 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:615656  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the highest score in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.974). The patient's intellectual disability, developmental delay, and dysmorphic features are consistent with the clinical presentation of this syndrome [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: intellectual disability, X-linked, syndromic, Bain type  \nOMIM: OMIM:300534  \nDescription: This diagnosis is plausible based on PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.928) and the presence of intellectual disability and syndromic features in the patient. The X-linked inheritance pattern may also explain the family history of similar symptoms [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: neurodevelopmental disorder with absent language and variable seizures  \nOMIM: OMIM:618863  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.924). The patient's absent language development and seizure activity strongly align with the described phenotype [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: neurodegeneration, childhood-onset, with cerebellar atrophy  \nOMIM: OMIM:618879  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.912) suggests this diagnosis based on the patient's neurodegenerative symptoms and cerebellar involvement. While less specific, the phenotype matches key features [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I; NF1  \nOMIM: OMIM:162200  \nDescription: Zero-Shot Diagnosis ranked this as the top candidate (Rank: 1). The presence of neurocutaneous findings, developmental delay, and possible café-au-lait macules in the patient supports this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: SMITH-MAGENIS SYNDROME; SMS  \nOMIM: OMIM:182290  \nDescription: Zero-Shot Diagnosis ranked this third (Rank: 3). The patient's behavioral abnormalities, sleep disturbances, and dysmorphic features align with the phenotype of Smith-Magenis syndrome [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: ANGELMAN SYNDROME; AS  \nOMIM: OMIM:105830  \nDescription: Zero-Shot Diagnosis ranked this fourth (Rank: 4). The patient's developmental delay, absent speech, and seizure activity are consistent with Angelman syndrome [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME; MOWS  \nOMIM: OMIM:235730  \nDescription: Zero-Shot Diagnosis ranked this fifth (Rank: 5). The patient's intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and congenital anomalies align with the phenotype of Mowat-Wilson syndrome [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY WITH DYSMORPHIC FACIES AND DENTAL ANOMALIES  \nOMIM: OMIM:619228  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.727) suggests this diagnosis based on the patient's developmental delay and dysmorphic features. Dental anomalies may also be present, warranting further investigation [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: DELPIRE-MCNEILL SYNDROME  \nOMIM: OMIM:619083  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.720) supports this diagnosis due to overlapping features of developmental delay and dysmorphic facies. The evidence is weaker compared to higher-ranked candidates [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: SIMPSON-GOLABI-BEHMEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1; SGBS1  \nOMIM: OMIM:312870  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.474) suggests this diagnosis based on facial dysmorphology. However, the evidence is limited and less consistent with the patient's broader phenotype [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: AU-KLINE SYNDROME; AUKS  \nOMIM: OMIM:616580  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.462) supports this diagnosis based on facial features. The evidence is weaker compared to other candidates, and the phenotype overlap is less specific [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 40; MRD40  \nOMIM: OMIM:616286  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.462) suggests this diagnosis based on dysmorphic features and intellectual disability. However, the evidence is less robust compared to higher-ranked candidates [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: OGDEN SYNDROME; OGDNS  \nOMIM: OMIM:300855  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.458) supports this diagnosis based on facial dysmorphology. The evidence is limited and does not strongly align with the patient's broader phenotype [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 16  \nDisease: CK SYNDROME; CKS  \nOMIM: OMIM:300831  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.458) suggests this diagnosis based on facial features. However, the evidence is weaker and less consistent with the patient's overall clinical presentation [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 17  \nDisease: SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT 5  \nOMIM: OMIM:615432  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.718) suggests this diagnosis based on language impairment. However, the evidence is less specific and does not fully explain the patient's broader phenotype [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 18  \nDisease: INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 50, WITH BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES  \nOMIM: OMIM:617787  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.718) supports this diagnosis based on intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities. The evidence is weaker compared to higher-ranked candidates [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 19  \nDisease: EPILEPSY, FOCAL, WITH SPEECH DISORDER AND WITH OR WITHOUT IMPAIRED INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \nOMIM: OMIM:245570  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.705) suggests this diagnosis based on epilepsy and speech disorder. However, the evidence is less robust and does not fully align with the patient's broader phenotype [3].  \n---"
