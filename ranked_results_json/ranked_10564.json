Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Slender long bone (Concept Id: C1833144) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (WDRTS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative gene(s): POLR3A  \n- Inheritance pattern: Autosomal recessive  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)  \n- Neonatal progeroid appearance (aged facial features, sparse scalp hair, prominent veins)  \n- Lipodystrophy (generalized loss of subcutaneous fat)  \n- Failure to thrive  \n- Hypotonia  \n- Intellectual disability  \n- Dental anomalies (e.g., delayed eruption, hypodontia)  \n- Sparse or absent eyebrows and eyelashes  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Neonatal onset of progeroid features, distinguishing it from other progeroid syndromes that typically present later in life.  \n- Generalized lipodystrophy present from birth, unlike segmental or progressive lipodystrophy seen in other conditions.  \n- Prominent scalp veins and sparse hair, which are more pronounced than in other progeroid syndromes.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Neonatal progeroid appearance with prominent scalp veins and sparse hair.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of progressive neurological decline, which is seen in some other progeroid syndromes.  \n- No evidence of hyperphagia, which is a feature of other syndromes with growth abnormalities.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The combination of neonatal progeroid appearance, generalized lipodystrophy, prominent scalp veins, and sparse hair, along with intrauterine growth retardation and intellectual disability, strongly suggests Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome.\n- Title: Downslanted palpebral fissures (Concept Id: C0423110) - MedGen\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nProteus syndrome (PS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative gene: *AKT1*  \n- Inheritance pattern: Sporadic (caused by post-zygotic mosaicism)  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Progressive, segmental, or patchy overgrowth of tissues  \n- Disproportionate skeletal overgrowth (e.g., macrodactyly, limb asymmetry)  \n- Connective tissue nevi (cerebriform or verrucous skin lesions)  \n- Vascular malformations (capillary, venous, or lymphatic)  \n- Lipomas or other adipose tissue abnormalities  \n- Overgrowth of visceral organs (e.g., spleen, liver)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Progressive nature of overgrowth, which is not present at birth but becomes apparent in early childhood  \n- Asymmetric and mosaic distribution of overgrowth  \n- Presence of cerebriform connective tissue nevi, which are highly characteristic  \n- Lack of family history due to sporadic occurrence  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Cerebriform connective tissue nevi (pathognomonic for Proteus syndrome)  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of intellectual disability (in most cases), which helps differentiate from other overgrowth syndromes like Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome  \n- Absence of generalized overgrowth at birth (overgrowth is segmental and develops postnatally)  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Progressive, asymmetric overgrowth combined with cerebriform connective tissue nevi and vascular malformations strongly suggests Proteus syndrome.\n",
  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliotic type 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:225400  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to the strong consensus across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.845) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.741). The patient's phenotype of joint hypermobility, kyphoscoliosis, and connective tissue abnormalities aligns well with the clinical features of this subtype [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, arthrochalasia type, 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:617821  \nDescription: Supported by high scores in both PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.807) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.754), this diagnosis is plausible given the patient's joint hypermobility and skeletal malformations. The arthrochalasia type is characterized by congenital bilateral hip dislocation and extreme joint laxity, which matches the reported findings [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Cutis laxa, autosomal dominant 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:123700  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.450) and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 2). The patient's loose skin, connective tissue abnormalities, and potential cardiovascular involvement are consistent with the clinical features of autosomal dominant cutis laxa [3], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:610168  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.809) highlights this diagnosis as plausible due to the presence of congenital heart defects and skeletal malformations. Loeys-Dietz syndrome is characterized by arterial aneurysms, craniofacial abnormalities, and joint hypermobility, which overlap with the patient's phenotype [1], [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:264090  \nDescription: Literature review strongly supports this diagnosis based on hallmark features such as neonatal progeroid appearance, generalized lipodystrophy, and prominent scalp veins. The patient's intrauterine growth retardation and sparse hair further align with this syndrome [6]. While not highlighted by analytical tools, the unique constellation of features makes this diagnosis clinically plausible [6].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Proteus syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:176920  \nDescription: Literature review suggests Proteus syndrome as a potential diagnosis due to the presence of skeletal overgrowth and connective tissue abnormalities. The progressive and asymmetric nature of overgrowth, along with vascular malformations, aligns with the patient's phenotype. However, the absence of hallmark cerebriform connective tissue nevi reduces its likelihood [7].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Wrinkly skin syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:606865  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.807) suggests this diagnosis based on the patient's loose skin and connective tissue abnormalities. However, the lack of additional supporting evidence from other tools or literature makes this diagnosis less likely compared to higher-ranked candidates [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Hutchinson-Gilford progeria  \nOMIM: OMIM:176670  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.408) highlights this diagnosis due to facial dysmorphology and progeroid features. However, the absence of hallmark findings such as progressive neurological decline and hyperphagia reduces its plausibility compared to Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome [3], [6].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with regression, abnormal movements, loss of speech, and seizures (NEDAMSS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:618512  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.423) suggests this diagnosis based on facial dysmorphology and neurodevelopmental regression. However, the lack of specific findings such as seizures or loss of speech in the patient reduces its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Short stature, onychodysplasia, facial dysmorphism, and hypotrichosis (SOFT syndrome)  \nOMIM: OMIM:614813  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.418) suggests this diagnosis based on facial dysmorphology and short stature. However, the absence of hallmark features such as onychodysplasia and hypotrichosis in the patient makes this diagnosis less likely [3].  "
