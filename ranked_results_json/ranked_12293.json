Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:122470  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's distinctive facial dysmorphism, including synophrys (unibrow), long eyelashes, and thin downturned lips, which align with hallmark features of Cornelia de Lange syndrome [1]. Additionally, the presence of intellectual disability, prenatal growth retardation, and limb abnormalities further corroborates this diagnosis [2]. The absence of progressive neurodegeneration, as noted in the literature, helps differentiate this syndrome from other neurodevelopmental disorders [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia and speech delay, with or without seizures (NEDHSS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:618896  \nDescription: The patient's global developmental delay, hypotonia, and speech delay are consistent with the phenotype of NEDHSS [1]. Progressive motor regression, which is a hallmark of this disorder, aligns with the clinical presentation [2]. The absence of dysmorphic facial features, as noted in the literature, further supports this diagnosis, distinguishing it from other syndromes with overlapping developmental delay [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:130650  \nDescription: The patient's macrocephaly and potential overgrowth features are consistent with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome [1]. This diagnosis is ranked highly due to its prominence in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and its association with neurodevelopmental anomalies [2]. However, additional hallmark features such as abdominal wall defects or neonatal hypoglycemia were not explicitly noted, which slightly lowers its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Sotos syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:117550  \nDescription: The presence of macrocephaly and developmental delay aligns with the phenotype of Sotos syndrome [1]. This diagnosis is supported by its high rank in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and its association with overgrowth syndromes [2]. However, the absence of characteristic facial features such as a prominent forehead and pointed chin reduces its likelihood [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Stankiewicz-Isidor syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:616638  \nDescription: The patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and skeletal anomalies are consistent with Stankiewicz-Isidor syndrome [1]. This diagnosis is supported by a high score in the PubCaseFinder report, indicating strong phenotype matching [2]. However, the lack of specific hallmark features such as limb anomalies or cardiac defects in the clinical presentation slightly lowers its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: DeSanto-Shinawi syndrome due to WAC point mutation  \nOMIM: OMIM:615823  \nDescription: The patient's intellectual disability and dysmorphic features align with the phenotype of DeSanto-Shinawi syndrome [1]. This diagnosis is supported by a high score in the PubCaseFinder report and its association with neurodevelopmental disorders [2]. However, the absence of specific features such as relative macrocephaly or cardiac anomalies reduces its likelihood [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with relative macrocephaly and with or without cardiac or endocrine anomalies  \nOMIM: OMIM:618123  \nDescription: The patient's macrocephaly and developmental delay are consistent with this disorder [1]. This diagnosis is supported by a high score in the PubCaseFinder report, indicating strong phenotype matching [2]. However, the absence of cardiac or endocrine anomalies in the clinical presentation slightly lowers its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Williams-Beuren region duplication syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:609757  \nDescription: The patient's developmental delay and potential craniofacial dysmorphism align with the phenotype of Williams-Beuren region duplication syndrome [1]. This diagnosis is supported by a moderate score in the Phenotype Similarity Search report [2]. However, the absence of hallmark features such as hypercalcemia or cardiovascular anomalies reduces its likelihood [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Okur-Chung neurodevelopmental syndrome (OCNDS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:617062  \nDescription: The patient's developmental delay and dysmorphic features align with the phenotype of OCNDS [1]. This diagnosis is supported by a moderate score in the GestaltMatcher report [2]. However, the absence of specific hallmark features such as seizures or progressive neurodegeneration reduces its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Potocki-Lupski syndrome (PTLS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:610883  \nDescription: The patient's developmental delay and potential craniofacial dysmorphism align with the phenotype of PTLS [1]. This diagnosis is supported by its inclusion in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report [2]. However, the absence of hallmark features such as duplication of chromosome 17p11.2 or cardiovascular anomalies reduces its likelihood [3].  \n\n"
