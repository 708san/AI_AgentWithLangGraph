  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome (KOS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:216370  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by consensus across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.866) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.474). The patient’s phenotype, including facial dysmorphology, intellectual developmental delay, and hypotonia, aligns closely with the clinical features of KOS [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:607872  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible based on a strong PubCaseFinder score (0.858) and the presence of intellectual disability, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features, which are hallmark symptoms of this syndrome [1]. The phenotype similarity search also supports chromosomal deletion syndromes as a potential diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Mowat-Wilson syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:235730  \nDescription: Ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, this syndrome is supported by the presence of intellectual disability, dysmorphic facial features, and congenital anomalies such as cryptorchidism and inguinal hernia, which are consistent with the patient’s phenotype [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Peters plus syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:261540  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a high PubCaseFinder score (0.830) and the presence of dysmorphic features, developmental delay, and eye anomalies, which are characteristic of Peters plus syndrome [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome with a score of 0.482, and the patient’s dysmorphic features, developmental delay, and hypotonia align with this diagnosis. However, it is ranked lower due to weaker consensus across tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Chromosome 14q11-q22 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:613457  \nDescription: Phenotype similarity search identified this syndrome with a high score (0.841). The patient’s intellectual disability, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features are consistent with chromosomal deletion syndromes, though specific evidence for this deletion is limited [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder with impaired language and dysmorphic facies  \nOMIM: OMIM:618748  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.829) and phenotype similarity search (Score: 0.823) both support this diagnosis. The patient’s intellectual disability, language impairment, and dysmorphic features align with this disorder [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Pallister-W syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:601803  \nDescription: Ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, Pallister-W syndrome is supported by the presence of dysmorphic features and developmental delay. However, it is ranked lower due to limited evidence from other tools [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia and speech delay, with or without seizures  \nOMIM: OMIM:620455  \nDescription: Phenotype similarity search identified this disorder with a score of 0.818. The patient’s hypotonia, developmental delay, and speech impairment are consistent with this diagnosis, though it lacks strong consensus across tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:135900  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder identified Coffin-Siris syndrome with a score of 0.828. The patient’s developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features align with this diagnosis, but it is ranked lower due to weaker evidence from other tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Menke-Hennekam syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:618332  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified Menke-Hennekam syndrome with a score of 0.465. The patient’s dysmorphic features and developmental delay are consistent with this diagnosis, but it is ranked lower due to limited evidence from other tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Congenital disorder of glycosylation with defective fucosylation 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:618324  \nDescription: Phenotype similarity search identified this disorder with a score of 0.815. The patient’s developmental delay and hypotonia align with this diagnosis, but it is ranked lower due to limited consensus across tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Lissencephaly 9 with complex brainstem malformation  \nOMIM: OMIM:618325  \nDescription: Phenotype similarity search identified this disorder with a score of 0.818. The patient’s developmental delay and hypotonia are consistent with this diagnosis, but it is ranked lower due to limited evidence from other tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:618583  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified this syndrome with a score of 0.508. The patient’s dysmorphic features and developmental delay align with this diagnosis, but it is ranked lower due to limited evidence from other tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: Congenital hypotonia, epilepsy, developmental delay, and digital anomalies (CHEDDA)  \nOMIM: OMIM:618548  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified CHEDDA with a score of 0.462. The patient’s hypotonia, developmental delay, and dysmorphic features align with this diagnosis, but it is ranked lower due to limited evidence from other tools [2].  \n\n"
