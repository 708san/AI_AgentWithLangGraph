  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Branchiooculofacial syndrome (BOFS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:113620  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to its consistent ranking across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 1.000) and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 2). The patient’s phenotype of craniofacial dysmorphism, branchial anomalies, and ocular features aligns strongly with BOFS [1], [2]. Supporting literature also highlights BOFS as a key candidate for cases with overlapping facial and branchial anomalies [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:147920  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome is strongly supported by Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1) and shares overlapping features with the patient’s phenotype, including facial dysmorphology, developmental delay, and hypotonia [2]. While not ranked as highly in other tools, Kabuki syndrome remains a plausible diagnosis due to its hallmark features matching the patient’s presentation [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Waardenburg syndrome, type 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:193500  \nDescription: Waardenburg syndrome, type 1, is supported by both Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 3) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.708). The patient’s phenotype of hearing loss and distinctive facial features aligns with this diagnosis. However, the absence of pigmentation anomalies in the patient’s report slightly reduces its plausibility [1], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Intellectual disability-hypotonic facies syndrome, X-linked, 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:300354  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.859) and matches the patient’s presentation of intellectual disability and hypotonia. The X-linked inheritance pattern may also be relevant depending on family history [1]. However, it is less consistently ranked across other tools, lowering its overall plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Basilicata-Akhtar syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:619768  \nDescription: Basilicata-Akhtar syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.857) and is associated with craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay, which overlap with the patient’s phenotype. However, it is not ranked in other tools, suggesting weaker consensus [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 5  \nOMIM: OMIM:615065  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.854) and is associated with joint contractures and developmental delay. While plausible, the lack of specific evidence for arthrogryposis in the patient’s phenotype reduces its ranking [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Ectodermal dysplasia 13, hair/tooth type  \nOMIM: OMIM:617392  \nDescription: Supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.717), this diagnosis involves ectodermal anomalies such as hair and dental abnormalities. While the patient’s phenotype may partially overlap, the lack of specific ectodermal findings reduces its plausibility [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Short stature, hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa, and distinctive facies  \nOMIM: OMIM:617763  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.706) and matches features such as hearing loss and distinctive facial features. However, the absence of retinitis pigmentosa in the patient’s phenotype weakens the case for this diagnosis [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Cohen-Gibson syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:617561  \nDescription: Cohen-Gibson syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.418) and involves craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay. However, the lower score and lack of consensus across tools reduce its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy  \nOMIM: OMIM:158900  \nDescription: Supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.457), this diagnosis involves muscular dystrophy and facial weakness. While facial features may overlap, the absence of muscular findings in the patient’s phenotype makes this diagnosis less likely [3].  \n\n"
