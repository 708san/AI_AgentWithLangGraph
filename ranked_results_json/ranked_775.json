Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Intellectual Developmental Disorder with Autism and Speech Delay  \nOMIM: OMIM:606053  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and language delay, which align with hallmark features described in the literature [1]. The phenotype similarity search report also ranked this condition highly (Score: 0.764), indicating significant overlap with the patient's clinical presentation [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Beck-Fahrner syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:618798  \nDescription: The high score (0.954) in the PubCaseFinder report suggests strong phenotype matching with the patient’s features, including neurodevelopmental delay and dysmorphic facies [1]. This condition is also associated with intellectual disability, which is consistent with the patient's clinical findings [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Dysmorphic Facies and Distal Skeletal Anomalies  \nOMIM: OMIM:618891  \nDescription: This diagnosis is plausible due to the overlap of dysmorphic facial features and neurodevelopmental delay observed in the patient. The PubCaseFinder report assigned a high score (0.911), further supporting this match [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 117  \nOMIM: OMIM:616330  \nDescription: The patient’s developmental delay and possible neurological involvement align with this diagnosis. The phenotype similarity search report ranked this condition highly (Score: 0.750), indicating significant overlap with the patient’s clinical presentation [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Intellectual Disability, Autosomal Dominant 57  \nOMIM: OMIM:617824  \nDescription: This condition is supported by the patient’s intellectual disability and developmental delay, which match the phenotype described in the PubCaseFinder report (Score: 0.911) [1]. The autosomal dominant inheritance pattern is consistent with the family history provided [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Kabuki Syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Although ranked lower in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report (Rank: 5), Kabuki syndrome 2 remains plausible due to the presence of developmental delay and dysmorphic facial features. These findings are consistent with the patient’s phenotype [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Cerebellar Atrophy and Motor Dysfunction  \nOMIM: OMIM:619333  \nDescription: The phenotype similarity search report (Score: 0.733) suggests overlap with the patient’s neurodevelopmental delay and motor dysfunction. Cerebellar involvement could explain coordination issues noted in the clinical evaluation [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Palatal Anomalies-Widely Spaced Teeth-Facial Dysmorphism-Developmental Delay Syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:619221  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the patient’s dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay, which align with the phenotype described in the PubCaseFinder report (Score: 0.911) [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Mental Retardation, Autosomal Dominant 58  \nOMIM: OMIM:618736  \nDescription: The GestaltMatcher report (Score: 0.458) suggests some overlap with the patient’s intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. However, the lower score reduces the plausibility compared to other candidates [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Hypermobility Type  \nOMIM: OMIM:130020  \nDescription: While ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, this condition is less plausible due to the absence of hallmark connective tissue findings such as joint hypermobility or skin elasticity in the patient’s phenotype [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Spastic Paraplegia 53, Autosomal Recessive  \nOMIM: OMIM:614898  \nDescription: The phenotype similarity search report (Score: 0.727) suggests some overlap with the patient’s motor dysfunction. However, the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern does not align with the family history provided [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Hyperphenylalaninemia, Mild, Non-BH4-Deficient  \nOMIM: OMIM:617384  \nDescription: This diagnosis is less plausible due to the absence of biochemical findings or metabolic abnormalities in the patient’s clinical evaluation. The phenotype similarity search report (Score: 0.719) provides limited support [2].  \n\n---"
