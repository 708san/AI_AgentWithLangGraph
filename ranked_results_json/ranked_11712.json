Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: MENKE-HENNEKAM SYNDROME 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:618332  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to the strong phenotype similarity score (0.858) and the overlap with the patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and intellectual developmental delay. The syndrome is characterized by psychomotor retardation and distinctive facial features, which align with the patient's presentation [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: The PubCaseFinder report provides a high score (0.812) for this syndrome, which is consistent with the patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and intellectual disability. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is also associated with skeletal anomalies, further supporting this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: KABUKI SYNDROME 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool (Rank: 2) and the patient's facial dysmorphology, developmental delay, and hypotonia. Kabuki syndrome is known for its distinctive facial features and intellectual disability, which match the phenotype consensus [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: CLEFT PALATE, PSYCHOMOTOR RETARDATION, AND DISTINCTIVE FACIAL FEATURES  \nOMIM: OMIM:616728  \nDescription: The Phenotype Similarity Search report provides a high score (0.854), and the syndrome's features align with the patient's craniofacial anomalies and developmental delay. The presence of psychomotor retardation further supports this diagnosis [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: FAUNDES-BANKA SYNDROME  \nOMIM: OMIM:619376  \nDescription: This syndrome is ranked highly in the Phenotype Similarity Search report (Score: 0.853). The patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and intellectual disability are consistent with the features of this syndrome, which includes developmental delay and distinctive facial features [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: autosomal dominant intellectual disability-craniofacial anomalies-cardiac defects syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:615879  \nDescription: The PubCaseFinder report provides a strong score (0.802) for this syndrome, which matches the patient's craniofacial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, and potential cardiac anomalies. These features are characteristic of this syndrome [6].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: BLEPHAROPHIMOSIS, PTOSIS, AND EPICANTHUS INVERSUS; BPES  \nOMIM: OMIM:110100  \nDescription: Ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, this syndrome is characterized by distinctive craniofacial features, including blepharophimosis and ptosis, which overlap with the patient's phenotype. However, the lack of intellectual disability in BPES makes it less plausible compared to other candidates [7].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: WIEDEMANN-STEINER SYNDROME  \nOMIM: OMIM:605130  \nDescription: The Phenotype Similarity Search report provides a strong score (0.848). Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome is associated with intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and developmental delay, which align with the patient's presentation [8].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies, seizures, and distal limb anomalies  \nOMIM: OMIM:618349  \nDescription: The PubCaseFinder report provides a score of 0.797 for this syndrome. While the craniofacial dysmorphism and intellectual disability are consistent, the absence of seizures in the patient makes this diagnosis less likely [9].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: chromosome 2p16.1-p15 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:612513  \nDescription: The PubCaseFinder report provides a score of 0.793 for this syndrome. The craniofacial dysmorphism and intellectual disability align with the patient's phenotype, but the lack of specific deletion testing results limits the diagnostic certainty [10].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: Ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, this syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features and developmental delay. However, the absence of limb anomalies in the patient makes this diagnosis less plausible [11].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: COFFIN-SIRIS SYNDROME 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:614607  \nDescription: Ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, this syndrome is associated with developmental delay and coarse facial features. While there is some overlap with the patient's phenotype, the lack of specific features such as fifth-digit hypoplasia reduces its likelihood [12].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: KAUFMAN OCULOCEREBROFACIAL SYNDROME; KOS  \nOMIM: OMIM:216901  \nDescription: The GestaltMatcher report provides a moderate score (0.510). This syndrome is characterized by craniofacial anomalies and intellectual disability, which partially align with the patient's presentation. However, the evidence is weaker compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [13].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: PRADER-WILLI SYNDROME; PWS  \nOMIM: OMIM:176270  \nDescription: The GestaltMatcher report provides a moderate score (0.507). While PWS is associated with intellectual disability and distinctive facial features, the absence of hyperphagia and hypotonia in the patient makes this diagnosis less plausible [14].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: SCHINZEL-GIEDION MIDFACE RETRACTION SYNDROME  \nOMIM: OMIM:269150  \nDescription: The GestaltMatcher report provides a score of 0.482. This syndrome is characterized by severe intellectual disability and midface retraction, which partially align with the patient's phenotype. However, the evidence is weaker compared to other candidates [15].  \n\n"
