Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1].

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Aarskog-Scott syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:305400  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's short stature, facial dysmorphism (including hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, and widow's peak), and digital anomalies such as brachydactyly and syndactyly [1]. The hallmark feature of shawl scrotum in males further strengthens this diagnosis, as it is a distinguishing characteristic not typically seen in other syndromes with overlapping features [2]. The absence of severe intellectual disability aligns with the phenotype consensus [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Winter syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:601928  \nDescription: The patient's craniofacial features, including highly arched eyebrows, anteverted nares, long philtrum, ptosis, and retrognathia, strongly suggest Winter syndrome [4]. These features form a unique constellation that differentiates this condition from other syndromes. The presence of hypertelorism and epicanthal folds further supports this diagnosis [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, including long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [6]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [7]. The generative AI-based ranking also places this syndrome high in plausibility [8].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Craniofacial dysmorphism, skeletal anomalies, and impaired intellectual development 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:618164  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and intellectual impairment, which align with the phenotype-based scoring from PubCaseFinder [9]. The skeletal anomalies noted in the literature further strengthen the plausibility of this diagnosis [10].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Teebi-Shaltout syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:601551  \nDescription: The patient's craniofacial features, including hypertelorism and other dysmorphic traits, align with Teebi-Shaltout syndrome [11]. The high phenotype similarity score from PubCaseFinder supports this diagnosis [12].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 is supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology and developmental delay, which are hallmark features of this condition [13]. The generative AI-based ranking places this syndrome within the top five plausible diagnoses [14].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Acrofrontofacionasal dysostosis 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:239710  \nDescription: The patient's craniofacial anomalies, including hypertelorism and nasal dysplasia, align with acrofrontofacionasal dysostosis 2 [15]. The phenotype similarity search score further supports this diagnosis [16].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Blepharophimosis with facial and genital anomalies and impaired intellectual development  \nOMIM: OMIM:604314  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology and intellectual impairment, which align with the phenotype similarity search findings [17]. The genital anomalies noted in the literature further strengthen the plausibility of this diagnosis [18].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Robinow-Sorauf syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:180700  \nDescription: The patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and skeletal anomalies align with Robinow-Sorauf syndrome [19]. The generative AI-based ranking places this syndrome as a plausible candidate [20].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:115150  \nDescription: The patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay align with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome 1 [21]. The phenotype-based scoring from PubCaseFinder supports this diagnosis [22].  \n\n"
