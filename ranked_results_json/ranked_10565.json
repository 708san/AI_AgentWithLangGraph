Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Marfan syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:154700  \nDescription: Marfan syndrome is strongly supported by the patient's tall stature, disproportionately long limbs (dolichostenomelia), arachnodactyly, scoliosis, and joint hypermobility [1]. The cardiovascular findings, such as aortic root dilation, are hallmark features that distinguish Marfan syndrome from other connective tissue disorders [2]. Additionally, the absence of significant skin fragility or atrophic scarring further differentiates it from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliotic type 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:225400  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the patient's joint hypermobility, scoliosis, and hypotonia, which align with the phenotype of kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [1]. The high score from PubCaseFinder (0.864) and the overlap with connective tissue disorder features strengthen the plausibility of this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:610168  \nDescription: Loeys-Dietz syndrome is plausible due to the presence of congenital heart defects and skeletal malformations, which are hallmark features of this condition [1].

The condition ranked highly in both Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank 4) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.716), indicating strong evidence across multiple tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Cutis laxa, autosomal dominant 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:123700  \nDescription: Cutis laxa is supported by the patient's skin laxity and connective tissue abnormalities [1]. The high rank in Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank 1) and the presence of overlapping features with other connective tissue disorders make this diagnosis plausible [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, spondylocheirodysplastic type  \nOMIM: OMIM:612350  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the patient's skeletal malformations and joint hypermobility, which are consistent with the phenotype of spondylocheirodysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [1]. The PubCaseFinder score (0.818) and overlap with connective tissue disorder features strengthen the plausibility of this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: PYCR1-related de Barsy syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:219150  \nDescription: De Barsy syndrome is supported by the patient's developmental delay, skin laxity, and skeletal abnormalities [1]. The PubCaseFinder score (0.816) and overlap with connective tissue disorder phenotypes provide moderate evidence for this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal recessive 72  \nOMIM: OMIM:618443  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the patient's developmental delay and intellectual disability [1]. The GestaltMatcher score (0.448) provides some evidence, although it is less robust compared to other candidates [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Sotos syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:117550  \nDescription: Sotos syndrome is plausible due to the patient's developmental delay and overgrowth features [1]. The GestaltMatcher score (0.442) provides moderate evidence, although it is less consistent across tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Alagille syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:118450  \nDescription: Alagille syndrome is supported by the presence of congenital heart defects and skeletal abnormalities [1]. The GestaltMatcher score (0.423) provides some evidence, but it is less robust compared to other candidates [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Contractural arachnodactyly, congenital  \nOMIM: OMIM:121050  \nDescription: Contractural arachnodactyly is supported by the patient's arachnodactyly and skeletal malformations [1].
