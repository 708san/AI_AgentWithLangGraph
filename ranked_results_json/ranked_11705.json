Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1].
