Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Costello syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:218040  \nDescription: Costello syndrome is consistently ranked highly across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.857) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.514). The patient’s phenotype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, developmental delay, and distinctive facial features aligns strongly with the syndrome [1], [2]. Additionally, the literature supports the presence of hypotonia and feeding difficulties, which are hallmark features of Costello syndrome [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:163950 (Noonan syndrome 1) / OMIM:618499 (Noonan syndrome 11)  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome is supported by multiple tools, including Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1 for NS12) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.833 for NS11). The patient’s hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphology (e.g., ptosis, short nasal root) are characteristic of Noonan syndrome [1], [4]. The overlap in phenotypes with Costello syndrome makes differentiation challenging, but the high consensus across tools strengthens its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is ranked fourth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool and is supported by the patient’s distinctive facial features and developmental delay. While hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is less commonly associated, the presence of hypotonia and feeding difficulties aligns with Kabuki syndrome [2], [3]. The syndrome’s hallmark facial dysmorphology overlaps with the patient’s phenotype, making it a plausible diagnosis [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome is ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool and is supported by the presence of coloboma and heart defects, which are key features of the syndrome [2]. While the patient’s hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not a classic finding, the overlap in developmental delay and distinctive facial features supports its inclusion in the differential diagnosis [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Williams syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:194050  \nDescription: Williams syndrome is ranked highly in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.854). The patient’s hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and developmental delay are consistent with the syndrome’s cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental features [1]. However, the absence of hallmark features such as hypercalcemia and overly friendly personality reduces its plausibility compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:615009  \nDescription: Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome is identified in GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.530). The patient’s developmental delay and distinctive facial features align with the syndrome’s phenotype. However, the lack of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other hallmark features weakens its plausibility compared to other candidates [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:270400  \nDescription: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is supported by literature findings describing intellectual disability, microcephaly, and distinctive facial features, which overlap with the patient’s phenotype [3]. However, the absence of biochemical evidence (elevated 7-DHC levels) and syndactyly reduces its likelihood [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is identified in GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.496). The patient’s developmental delay and distinctive facial features are consistent with the syndrome. However, the absence of hallmark features such as broad thumbs and toes reduces its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Facial-Cranial-Muscular Syndrome, Unnamed (FCMSU)  \nOMIM: Not available  \nDescription: FCMSU is supported by literature findings describing distinctive facial features, muscular hypertrophy, and cardiac ventricular involvement [3]. While hypertrophic cardiomyopathy aligns with the patient’s phenotype, the lack of detailed genetic evidence and hallmark features weakens its plausibility [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:135900  \nDescription: Coffin-Siris syndrome is ranked in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.830) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.512). The patient’s developmental delay and hypotonia are consistent with the syndrome. However, the absence of hallmark features such as fifth-digit hypoplasia reduces its likelihood compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [1], [2].  \n\n"
