Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Concept Id: C0007194) - MedGen -\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nSmith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative gene: *DHCR7*  \n- Inheritance pattern: Autosomal recessive  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Intellectual disability and developmental delay  \n- Microcephaly  \n- Distinctive facial features (e.g., ptosis, short nasal root, anteverted nares)  \n- Syndactyly of the second and third toes  \n- Genital anomalies (e.g., hypospadias, ambiguous genitalia)  \n- Hypotonia  \n- Feeding difficulties in infancy  \n- Growth restriction  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) levels with reduced cholesterol levels in biochemical testing  \n- Syndactyly of the second and third toes, which is uncommon in other syndromes with overlapping features  \n- Cholesterol metabolism defect, which is not a feature of most other syndromes with similar phenotypes  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Elevated 7-DHC levels in plasma or tissues  \n- Syndactyly of the second and third toes  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of hyperphagia (distinguishing it from Prader-Willi syndrome)  \n- No significant organomegaly (distinguishing it from lysosomal storage disorders)  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Combination of intellectual disability, microcephaly, distinctive facial features, syndactyly of the second and third toes, and biochemical evidence of defective cholesterol metabolism (elevated 7-DHC and low cholesterol levels).\n- Title: Ventricular hypertrophy (Concept Id: C0340279) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Facial-Cranial-Muscular Syndrome, Unnamed (FCMSU)  \n\n**Genetics:** X-linked disorder; causative gene not specified in the provided text.  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Distinctive facial appearance  \n- Muscular hypertrophy  \n- Cardiac ventricular involvement  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of muscular hypertrophy and cardiac ventricular abnormalities, which is uncommon in other X-linked syndromes.  \n- Specific facial dysmorphisms (details not provided in the text but implied as distinctive).  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Muscular hypertrophy in the context of an X-linked disorder.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Not specified in the provided text.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The triad of distinctive facial features, muscular hypertrophy, and cardiac ventricular involvement strongly suggests FCMSU.  \n\n(Note: The summary is based on the limited information provided in the text.
