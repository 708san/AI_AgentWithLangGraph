Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Thick vermilion border (Concept Id: C1836543) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to create a structured summary. Please provide the full article or additional context for me to proceed.\n- Title: Thin upper lip vermilion (Concept Id: C1865017) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Femoral-Facial Syndrome (FFS), also known as Femoral Hypoplasia-Unusual Facies Syndrome (FHUFS)\n\n**Genetics:**  \n- No specific causative gene identified.  \n- Typically sporadic in occurrence; no clear inheritance pattern established.\n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Bilateral or unilateral femoral hypoplasia or aplasia.  \n- Characteristic facial features, including a short nose with a broad nasal bridge, long philtrum, and thin upper lip.  \n- Limb anomalies, particularly affecting the lower extremities.  \n- Possible renal anomalies.  \n- Congenital heart defects in some cases.  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- The combination of femoral hypoplasia or aplasia with characteristic facial dysmorphism is highly suggestive of FFS.  \n- Absence of upper limb involvement, which helps distinguish it from other syndromes with limb anomalies (e.g., Holt-Oram syndrome).  \n- Lack of significant intellectual disability, which differentiates it from other syndromes with facial dysmorphism and limb anomalies.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Femoral hypoplasia or aplasia combined with the specific facial features described above.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of upper limb malformations.  \n- No significant intellectual disability.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The presence of femoral hypoplasia or aplasia, characteristic facial features (short nose, broad nasal bridge, long philtrum, thin upper lip), and absence of upper limb anomalies strongly point to FFS.\n",
