  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:163950  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome is strongly supported by multiple tools, including GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.635), Phenotype Similarity Search (Noonan syndrome 8, Score: 0.805; Noonan syndrome 5, Score: 0.801), and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1). The patient's phenotype aligns with hallmark features of Noonan syndrome, such as short stature, facial dysmorphology, and congenital heart defects [1], [2]. The consensus across tools and high scores make this the most plausible diagnosis.  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:115150  \nDescription: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.958) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.565). The patient's phenotype, including facial dysmorphology, developmental delay, and cardiac abnormalities, aligns with this diagnosis [1], [3]. While the scores are high, the evidence is slightly less consistent compared to Noonan syndrome.  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Costello syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:218040  \nDescription: Costello syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.953) and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 3). The phenotype overlap includes coarse facial features, developmental delay, and cardiac anomalies [1], [2]. While plausible, the evidence is less robust compared to Noonan syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome.  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is identified by Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 4). The patient's phenotype, including developmental delay and facial dysmorphology, shows partial overlap with Kabuki syndrome features [2]. However, the evidence is less consistent across tools, lowering its rank.  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Intellectual disability, X-linked syndromic, Turner type  \nOMIM: OMIM:300706  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.912). The patient's profound intellectual disability and syndromic features align with this condition [1]. However, the lack of consensus across tools reduces its plausibility.  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.802). The patient's developmental delay and dysmorphic features partially align with this diagnosis [3]. However, the evidence is limited to a single tool, reducing its rank.  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:614114  \nDescription: Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome 2 is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.798). The patient's phenotype shows partial overlap with features of this syndrome, including developmental delay and growth abnormalities [3]. The evidence is limited to one tool, making it less plausible.  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Aarskog-Scott syndrome, X-linked  \nOMIM: OMIM:305400  \nDescription: Aarskog-Scott syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.913). The patient's phenotype, including facial dysmorphology and developmental delay, aligns with this condition [1]. However, the lack of consensus across tools reduces its plausibility.  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Cayler cardiofacial syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:225020  \nDescription: Cayler cardiofacial syndrome is identified by Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 2). The patient's cardiac abnormalities and facial dysmorphology show partial overlap with this condition [2]. However, the evidence is less consistent across tools, lowering its rank.  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase deficiency  \nOMIM: OMIM:619859  \nDescription: Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase deficiency is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.800). The patient's phenotype shows partial overlap with features of this metabolic disorder, including developmental delay [3]. The evidence is limited to one tool, making it less plausible.  \n\n"
