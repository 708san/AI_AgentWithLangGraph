Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Menke-Hennekam syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:603802  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (highest phenotype-based score: 0.873) and GestaltMatcher (facial dysmorphology score: 0.448). The syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features, which align with the patient's reported symptoms [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: DeSanto-Shinawi syndrome due to WAC point mutation  \nOMIM: OMIM:615032  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder ranks this syndrome highly (score: 0.870), and it is associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and behavioral abnormalities, which match the patient's phenotype. The presence of dysmorphic features further supports this diagnosis [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300882  \nDescription: Zero-Shot Diagnosis ranks this syndrome as the most plausible (Rank: 1). It is characterized by distinctive facial features, developmental delay, and limb abnormalities, which overlap with the patient's phenotype. However, it is not strongly supported by other tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:607872  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder provides a high score (0.854) for this syndrome, which is associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features. The phenotype similarity aligns well with the patient's reported symptoms [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Suleiman-El-Hattab syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:618396  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder ranks this syndrome highly (score: 0.850).
