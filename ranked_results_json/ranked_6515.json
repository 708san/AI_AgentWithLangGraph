  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Temtamy Preaxial Brachydactyly Syndrome (TPBS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:605282  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's brachydactyly and hyperphalangism, which are hallmark features of TPBS [1]. Additionally, the presence of facial dysmorphism and dental anomalies aligns with the phenotype described in the literature [2]. Sensorineural hearing loss, noted in the supporting literature, further strengthens the plausibility of this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Orofaciodigital Syndrome I  \nOMIM: OMIM:311200  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the patient's craniofacial anomalies and digital malformations, which are characteristic of Orofaciodigital Syndrome I [1]. The high scores from PubCaseFinder (0.795) and Phenotype Similarity Search (0.737 for a related subtype) suggest strong phenotypic overlap [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:130650  \nDescription: The patient's macrosomia, macroglossia, and abdominal wall defects are hallmark features of BWS [2]. Supporting literature highlights the presence of ear pits/creases and hemihyperplasia, which are unique to this syndrome and differentiate it from other overgrowth conditions [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Kabuki Syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki Syndrome 2 is plausible due to the patient's facial dysmorphology and developmental delay, which are consistent with the syndrome [1]. The Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool ranked this highly (Rank 5), and the phenotype overlap supports this diagnosis [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Peters Plus Syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:261540  \nDescription: The patient's anterior segment abnormalities and short stature align with Peters Plus Syndrome [1]. PubCaseFinder provided a high score (0.862), indicating strong phenotypic similarity [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Alagille Syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:118450  \nDescription: The presence of liver abnormalities and characteristic facial features supports Alagille Syndrome 1 [1]. The Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool ranked this highly (Rank 3), and the phenotype overlap is consistent with the syndrome [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Weyers Acrofacial Dysostosis  \nOMIM: OMIM:193530  \nDescription: The patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and limb anomalies align with Weyers Acrofacial Dysostosis [3]. The Phenotype Similarity Search provided a high score (0.738), indicating strong phenotypic overlap [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange Syndrome 3  \nOMIM: OMIM:614062  \nDescription: The patient's developmental delay and limb abnormalities are consistent with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome 3 [1]. PubCaseFinder provided a high score (0.824), suggesting phenotypic similarity [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Ellis-Van Creveld Syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:225500  \nDescription: The patient's short stature and limb anomalies are characteristic of Ellis-Van Creveld Syndrome [1]. The Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool ranked this highly (Rank 4), and the phenotype overlap supports this diagnosis [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Angelman Syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:105830  \nDescription: The patient's developmental delay and characteristic facial features align with Angelman Syndrome [3]. GestaltMatcher provided a moderate score (0.395), indicating phenotypic overlap [3].  \n\n"
