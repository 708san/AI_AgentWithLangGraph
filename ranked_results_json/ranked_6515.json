Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII. Analytical Tool Reports\n\nPubCaseFinder Report (Phenotype-based):\n- Peters plus syndrome (Score: 0.862)\n- KBG syndrome (Score: 0.856)\n- Cornelia de Lange syndrome 3 (Score: 0.824)\n- Aarskog-Scott syndrome, X-linked (Score: 0.815)\n- orofaciodigital syndrome I (Score: 0.795)\n\nZero-Shot Diagnosis Report (Generative AI-based):\n- BRACHYDACTYLY, TYPE A1, B; BDA1B (Rank: 1)\n- ROBINOW-SORAUF SYNDROME (Rank: 2)\n- ALAGILLE SYNDROME 1; ALGS1 (Rank: 3)\n- ELLIS-VAN CREVELD SYNDROME; EVC (Rank: 4)\n- KABUKI SYNDROME 2; KABUK2 (Rank: 5)\n\nGestaltMatcher Report (Facial Dysmorphology-based):\n- Hyper-IgE recurrent infection syndrome (Score: 0.445)\n- FACIAL DYSMORPHISM, LENS DISLOCATION, ANTERIOR SEGMENT ABNORMALITIES, AND SPONTANEOUS FILTERING BLEBS; FDLAB (Score: 0.416)\n- ALACRIMA, ACHALASIA, AND MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME; AAMR (Score: 0.404)\n- Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (Score: 0.402)\n- ANGELMAN SYNDROME; AS (Score: 0.395)\n\nPhenotype Similarity Search Report (Vector-based):\n- WEYERS ACROFACIAL DYSOSTOSIS (OMIM: 193530, Score: 0.738)\n- OROFACIODIGITAL SYNDROME III (OMIM: 258850, Score: 0.737)\n- TEMTAMY PREAXIAL BRACHYDACTYLY SYNDROME (OMIM: 605282, Score: 0.732)\n- CHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH JOINT DISLOCATIONS, GPAPP TYPE (OMIM: 614078, Score: 0.731)\n- PIERRE ROBIN SEQUENCE WITH FACIAL AND DIGITAL ANOMALIES (OMIM: 311895, Score: 0.728)\n\nIII. Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Genetic consultations in the newborn 9780199990993, ...\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Genes: *CDKN1C*, *H19*, *KCNQ1OT1*  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Typically sporadic; can be autosomal dominant in familial cases  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Macrosomia (overgrowth)  \n- Macroglossia (enlarged tongue)  \n- Abdominal wall defects (e.g., omphalocele, umbilical hernia)  \n- Neonatal hypoglycemia  \n- Hemihyperplasia (asymmetric overgrowth)  \n- Ear creases or pits  \n- Increased risk of embryonal tumors (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Presence of ear pits or creases, which are uncommon in other overgrowth syndromes  \n- Combination of macrosomia with abdominal wall defects and macroglossia  \n- Hemihyperplasia is more pronounced and asymmetric compared to other overgrowth conditions  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Ear pits/creases  \n- Macroglossia  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of intellectual disability (in most cases), which can help differentiate from other syndromes with overgrowth and developmental delay  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The triad of macrosomia, macroglossia, and abdominal wall defects, particularly in the presence of ear pits/creases, strongly suggests Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome.\n- Title: Temtamy Preaxial Brachydactyly Syndrome (TPBS)\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Not specified in the provided text.\n\n**Genetics:** Autosomal recessive inheritance; causative gene not specified in the provided text.\n\n**Key Phenotypes:**\n- Brachydactyly\n- Hyperphalangism of digits\n- Facial dysmorphism\n- Dental anomalies\n- Sensorineural hearing loss\n\n**Differentiating Features:**\n- Combination of brachydactyly and hyperphalangism, which is less commonly seen together in other syndromes.\n- Presence of both dental anomalies and sensorineural hearing loss alongside skeletal abnormalities.\n\n**Hallmark(s):**\n- Hyperphalangism of digits in conjunction with brachydactyly.\n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**\n- Not specified in the provided text.\n\n**Unique Constellation:**\n- The co-occurrence of brachydactyly, hyperphalangism, facial dysmorphism, dental anomalies, and sensorineural hearing loss strongly suggests this diagnosis.\n- Title: Oligodontia in the Clinical Spectrum of Syndromes\n  Snippet: The provided text is insufficient to determine if it is medically related or to create a structured summary.
