  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Noonan syndrome - Wikipedia\n  Snippet: The provided text is insufficient to create a structured summary as it lacks comprehensive clinical information about the condition. Please provide a more detailed article or additional context for me to generate the requested summary.\n- Title: Webbed neck (Concept Id: C0221217) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** CHARGE Syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene(s): *CHD7*  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant (most cases are de novo mutations)  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Coloboma of the eye  \n- Heart defects (e.g., conotruncal anomalies)  \n- Choanal atresia (unilateral or bilateral)  \n- Growth retardation  \n- Developmental delay  \n- Genital hypoplasia (e.g., micropenis, cryptorchidism)  \n- Ear anomalies (e.g., malformed pinnae, hearing loss)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of coloboma, choanal atresia, and ear anomalies is highly suggestive.  \n- Inner ear malformations (e.g., hypoplastic semicircular canals) are a distinguishing feature on imaging.  \n- Unilateral or bilateral choanal atresia is more specific to CHARGE compared to other syndromes with overlapping features.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Hypoplastic or absent semicircular canals on imaging.  \n- Coloboma with choanal atresia.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of polydactyly (helps differentiate from conditions like Pallister-Hall syndrome).  \n- Absence of hyperphagia (distinguishes from Prader-Willi syndrome).  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The triad of coloboma, choanal atresia, and characteristic ear anomalies (including hearing loss) strongly points to CHARGE syndrome, especially when combined with semicircular canal hypoplasia and genital hypoplasia.\n",
  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:163950  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome is consistently ranked highly across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (scores ranging from 0.948 to 0.974), GestaltMatcher (score: 0.588), and Phenotype Similarity Search (e.g., Noonan syndrome 9, OMIM:616559, score: 0.844). The patient’s phenotype, including features such as webbed neck, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphology, aligns strongly with the clinical presentation of Noonan syndrome [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Costello syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:218040  \nDescription: Costello syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (score: 0.514) and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (rank: 3). The patient’s phenotype, including coarse facial features, developmental delay, and hypotonia, overlaps significantly with the clinical features of Costello syndrome. Additionally, the presence of cardiac anomalies further strengthens this diagnosis [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome is suggested by literature findings and supported by the presence of coloboma, heart defects, and developmental delay. The hallmark triad of coloboma, choanal atresia, and characteristic ear anomalies (including hearing loss) strongly aligns with the patient’s phenotype. Imaging findings, such as hypoplastic semicircular canals, would further confirm this diagnosis [3], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. The patient’s developmental delay, hypotonia, and facial dysmorphology (e.g., long palpebral fissures) are consistent with Kabuki syndrome. While not ranked as highly as other conditions, the phenotype overlap warrants consideration [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Peters plus syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:261540  \nDescription: Peters plus syndrome is identified in PubCaseFinder (score: 0.965). The patient’s phenotype, including developmental delay and eye anomalies, aligns with the clinical features of Peters plus syndrome. However, the lack of consensus across tools places this diagnosis lower in plausibility [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:115150  \nDescription: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (score: 0.541). The patient’s phenotype, including facial dysmorphology, developmental delay, and cardiac anomalies, overlaps with this condition. However, the evidence is less robust compared to other diagnoses [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Cayler cardiofacial syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:225290  \nDescription: Cayler cardiofacial syndrome is ranked second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. While the presence of cardiac anomalies and facial dysmorphology aligns with this condition, the lack of supporting evidence from other tools reduces its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Cree impaired intellectual development syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:606851  \nDescription: Cree impaired intellectual development syndrome is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (score: 0.869). The patient’s developmental delay and intellectual disability align with this condition. However, the absence of other hallmark features and limited consensus across tools places this diagnosis lower in plausibility [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Frias syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:609640  \nDescription: Frias syndrome is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (score: 0.840). While developmental delay and dysmorphic features are present, the lack of distinguishing features and consensus across tools makes this diagnosis less likely [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Cohen-Gibson syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:617561  \nDescription: Cohen-Gibson syndrome is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (score: 0.840). The patient’s developmental delay and hypotonia overlap with this condition, but the lack of specific features and consensus across tools reduces its plausibility [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Skin creases, congenital symmetric circumferential, 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:616734  \nDescription: This condition is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (score: 0.839). While the patient’s developmental delay and dysmorphic features may overlap, the lack of hallmark features and consensus across tools makes this diagnosis unlikely [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Shprintzen-Goldberg craniosynostosis syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:182212  \nDescription: Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (score: 0.498). While craniosynostosis and developmental delay may overlap, the lack of specific features and consensus across tools places this diagnosis lower in plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Opitz GBBB syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:300000  \nDescription: Opitz GBBB syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (score: 0.494). While developmental delay and dysmorphic features may overlap, the lack of distinguishing features and consensus across tools makes this diagnosis less likely [2].  "
