Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Branchiooculofacial syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:113620  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible based on its top score (1.000) in the PubCaseFinder report, which strongly aligns with the patient's phenotype. The syndrome is characterized by branchial cleft anomalies, ocular abnormalities, and distinctive facial features, which match the reported dysmorphic traits and developmental concerns [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: BRANCHIOOTORENAL SYNDROME 1; BOR1  \nOMIM: OMIM:113650  \nDescription: This diagnosis is ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, indicating strong generative AI-based evidence. BOR syndrome involves branchial arch anomalies, hearing loss, and renal malformations, which overlap with the patient's phenotype. The presence of branchial anomalies and dysmorphic features further supports this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Treacher Collins syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:154500  \nDescription: Treacher Collins syndrome is supported by multiple tools, including a high score (0.794) in the Phenotype Similarity Search report and a second-place rank in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. The syndrome is characterized by craniofacial dysmorphology, including mandibulofacial dysostosis, which aligns with the patient's facial features [3], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome is ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and is supported by the presence of coloboma, heart defects, and other dysmorphic features. While not the top-ranked diagnosis, the phenotype overlap with the patient's symptoms makes it a plausible candidate [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Fontaine progeroid syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:616793  \nDescription: This syndrome is ranked third in the PubCaseFinder report (score: 0.839). It is characterized by progeroid features, developmental delay, and dysmorphic traits, which partially overlap with the patient's phenotype. However, the evidence is less robust compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Orofaciodigital syndrome XIX  \nOMIM: OMIM:620107  \nDescription: This syndrome is supported by a high score (0.800) in the Phenotype Similarity Search report. It involves orofacial anomalies and digital malformations, which align with some of the patient's reported features. However, it is less strongly supported than other candidates [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is ranked fourth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. It is characterized by distinctive facial features, developmental delay, and hypotonia, which partially overlap with the patient's phenotype. The evidence is weaker compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Lateral meningocele syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:130720  \nDescription: This syndrome is ranked fifth in the PubCaseFinder report (score: 0.820). It involves skeletal anomalies, meningocele, and dysmorphic features, which show partial overlap with the patient's phenotype. However, the evidence is less compelling than other candidates [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Diamond-Blackfan anemia 15 with mandibulofacial dysostosis  \nOMIM: OMIM:606164  \nDescription: This syndrome is supported by a high score (0.788) in the Phenotype Similarity Search report. It involves anemia and craniofacial dysmorphology, which partially align with the patient's features. However, the evidence is weaker compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Burn-McKeown syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:608572  \nDescription: This syndrome is supported by a score of 0.787 in the Phenotype Similarity Search report. It involves craniofacial dysmorphology and hearing loss, which partially overlap with the patient's phenotype. The evidence is less robust compared to other candidates [4].  \n\n"
