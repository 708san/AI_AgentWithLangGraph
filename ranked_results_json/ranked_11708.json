  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible based on the strong phenotype match reported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.786) and the presence of hallmark features such as broad thumbs, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial dysmorphology [1]. Additionally, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is well-documented to overlap with developmental delay and skeletal anomalies, which align with the patient's clinical presentation [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Costello syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:218040  \nDescription: Costello syndrome is supported by findings from both PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.759) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.461), indicating consensus across tools. The patient's phenotype, including coarse facial features, developmental delay, and hypotonia, strongly aligns with this diagnosis [1], [3]. Furthermore, Costello syndrome is associated with cardiac anomalies, which may explain additional clinical findings [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Craniolenticulosutural dysplasia  \nOMIM: OMIM:607812  \nDescription: This diagnosis is ranked highly due to the strong phenotype similarity score (0.867) from the Phenotype Similarity Search tool. The patient's craniofacial dysmorphology, including sutural anomalies and skeletal findings, is consistent with this rare connective tissue disorder [4]. The presence of developmental delay further supports this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Larsen-like syndrome, B3GAT3 type  \nOMIM: OMIM:245600  \nDescription: Larsen-like syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.765), with features such as joint dislocations, skeletal abnormalities, and developmental delay matching the patient's clinical presentation [1]. This diagnosis is plausible given the overlap of connective tissue and skeletal findings [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is supported by the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool (Rank: 4), with features such as intellectual disability, distinctive facial dysmorphology, and hypotonia aligning with the patient's phenotype [3]. Kabuki syndrome is also known for its multisystem involvement, which may explain additional clinical findings [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:182212  \nDescription: Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.764), with features such as craniosynostosis, marfanoid habitus, and developmental delay matching the patient's phenotype [1]. While less strongly ranked than other candidates, the overlap of skeletal and connective tissue findings makes this diagnosis plausible [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Cleidocranial dysplasia, recessive form  \nOMIM: OMIM:119600  \nDescription: Cleidocranial dysplasia is ranked first by the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, with features such as clavicular hypoplasia, dental anomalies, and craniofacial dysmorphology aligning with the patient's phenotype [3]. However, the lack of consensus across other tools lowers its rank despite its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Floating-Harbor syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:136140  \nDescription: Floating-Harbor syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.481), with features such as triangular facial shape, delayed bone age, and speech delay matching the patient's phenotype [3]. While plausible, the lower score and lack of consensus across tools reduce its ranking [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:268310  \nDescription: Robinow syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.754), with features such as short stature, facial dysmorphology, and skeletal anomalies aligning with the patient's phenotype [1]. However, the absence of supporting evidence from other tools lowers its rank [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Craniofrontonasal syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:304110  \nDescription: Craniofrontonasal syndrome is ranked third by the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, with features such as hypertelorism, craniosynostosis, and skeletal anomalies aligning with the patient's phenotype [3]. However, the lack of consensus across tools reduces its ranking despite its plausibility [2].  \n\n"
