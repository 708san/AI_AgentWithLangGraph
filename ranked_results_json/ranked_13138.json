  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:163950  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to strong consensus across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.912), Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1), and GestaltMatcher (facial dysmorphology match, Score: 0.585). The patient’s phenotype of short stature, facial dysmorphology, and congenital heart defects aligns closely with the clinical features of Noonan syndrome [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:115150  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by high scores in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.981) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.477), as well as its inclusion in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis list (Rank: 3). The patient’s combination of facial dysmorphology, developmental delay, and cardiac anomalies strongly overlaps with the phenotype of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Costello syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:218040  \nDescription: Costello syndrome is a plausible diagnosis based on its high ranking in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.970) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.490). The patient’s phenotype of coarse facial features, developmental delay, and cardiac anomalies aligns with the clinical presentation of Costello syndrome [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 7  \nOMIM: OMIM:609942  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome 7 is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.936) and literature references [4]. The patient’s phenotype of short stature, facial dysmorphology, and cardiac anomalies matches the clinical features of this subtype of Noonan syndrome [1], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 3  \nOMIM: OMIM:609942  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome 3 is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.835) and literature references [4]. The patient’s phenotype of short stature, facial dysmorphology, and cardiac anomalies aligns with this subtype of Noonan syndrome [1], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 8  \nOMIM: OMIM:615355  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome 8 is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.842). The patient’s phenotype of short stature, facial dysmorphology, and cardiac anomalies overlaps with the clinical features of this subtype of Noonan syndrome [1], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Peters plus syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:261540  \nDescription: Peters plus syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.911). The patient’s phenotype of developmental delay and eye anomalies aligns with the clinical features of Peters plus syndrome, although it is less strongly supported compared to other diagnoses [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is supported by Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 5). The patient’s phenotype of developmental delay and facial dysmorphology shows partial overlap with Kabuki syndrome, but the evidence is weaker compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Cree impaired intellectual development syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:606851  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.848). The patient’s phenotype of intellectual disability and facial dysmorphology shows partial overlap, but the lack of cardiac anomalies makes this diagnosis less plausible [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Intellectual disability-obesity-prognathism-eye and skin anomalies syndrome  \nOMIM: Not specified  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by literature findings describing intellectual disability, obesity, prognathism, and eye anomalies. While some features overlap with the patient’s phenotype, the absence of cardiac anomalies and facial dysmorphology makes this diagnosis less likely [4].  \n\n---"
