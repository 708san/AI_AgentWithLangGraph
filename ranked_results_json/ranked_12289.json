  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder with speech delay, autism, and dysmorphic facies  \nOMIM: OMIM:618672  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible based on the strong phenotype match (Score: 0.860) from the Phenotype Similarity Search report. The patient’s symptoms, including intellectual disability, speech delay, and dysmorphic facial features, align closely with the described clinical features of this disorder [1]. Additionally, the presence of autism spectrum traits further supports this diagnosis [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, nystagmus, and obesity  \nOMIM: OMIM:617296  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the highest score (0.862) in the Phenotype Similarity Search report. The patient’s clinical presentation of intellectual disability and dysmorphic features overlaps significantly with the described phenotype. While nystagmus and obesity were not explicitly noted in the patient’s symptoms, the strong evidence from the analytical tool warrants consideration [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Koolen-de Vries syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:610443  \nDescription: This diagnosis is plausible based on the PubCaseFinder report (Score: 0.789) and the patient’s intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. Koolen-de Vries syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and distinctive facial features, which align with the patient’s phenotype [1]. The consensus across tools strengthens its ranking [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the PubCaseFinder report (Score: 0.786) and the patient’s dysmorphic features, including prominent nasal bridge and intellectual disability. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is characterized by broad thumbs, facial dysmorphism, and developmental delay, which partially overlap with the patient’s clinical findings [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Sotos syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:117550  \nDescription: Sotos syndrome was ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, suggesting strong plausibility. The patient’s dysmorphic features, including a prominent nasal bridge, and developmental delay align with the typical presentation of Sotos syndrome. However, the lack of consensus across tools slightly lowers its ranking [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Beck-Fahrner syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:618798  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the Phenotype Similarity Search report (Score: 0.855). Beck-Fahrner syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features, which overlap with the patient’s phenotype. However, the absence of specific hallmark features reduces its ranking [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Menke-Hennekam syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:618001  \nDescription: Menke-Hennekam syndrome was identified in the GestaltMatcher report (Score: 0.465). The syndrome is associated with intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and developmental delay, which partially align with the patient’s symptoms. However, the lower score and lack of consensus across tools reduce its plausibility [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Williams-Beuren syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:194050  \nDescription: Williams-Beuren syndrome was identified in the GestaltMatcher report (Score: 0.444). The syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features, developmental delay, and intellectual disability, which partially overlap with the patient’s phenotype. However, the lower score and lack of supporting evidence from other tools reduce its ranking [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Ogden syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:300855  \nDescription: Ogden syndrome was identified in the GestaltMatcher report (Score: 0.465). It is associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features. While there is some overlap with the patient’s symptoms, the lack of consensus across tools and lower score reduce its plausibility [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Phelan-McDermid syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:606232  \nDescription: Phelan-McDermid syndrome was ranked fourth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. It is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, and dysmorphic features, which partially align with the patient’s phenotype. However, the lack of consensus across tools and lower ranking reduce its plausibility [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Developmental delay with variable intellectual impairment and behavioral abnormalities  \nOMIM: OMIM:NA  \nDescription: This diagnosis was identified in the GestaltMatcher report (Score: 0.452). While the patient’s symptoms of developmental delay and intellectual disability align with this disorder, the lack of specific hallmark features and consensus across tools reduce its ranking [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Smith-Magenis syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:182290  \nDescription: Smith-Magenis syndrome was ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. It is characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, and dysmorphic features, which partially overlap with the patient’s phenotype. However, the lack of consensus across tools and lower ranking reduce its plausibility [1].  \n\n"
