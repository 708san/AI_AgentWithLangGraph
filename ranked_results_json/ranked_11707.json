Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:163950  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome is consistently identified across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.783) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.508). The patient's phenotype of facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and cardiac anomalies aligns strongly with the clinical features of Noonan syndrome [1], [2]. The consensus across tools and the high scores make this the most plausible diagnosis.  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome is ranked highly in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report (Rank: 3) and supported by the presence of coloboma, heart defects, and craniofacial anomalies in the phenotype data. These features are hallmark signs of CHARGE syndrome, making it a strong candidate [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is identified in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.780) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.465). The patient's craniofacial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and skeletal anomalies are consistent with this diagnosis. The involvement of CREBBP mutations further supports the plausibility [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Cohen-Gibson syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:617561  \nDescription: Cohen-Gibson syndrome is strongly supported by the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.845). The patient's macrocephaly, developmental delay, and craniofacial features align with the hallmark signs of this syndrome. The high score and phenotype overlap make this a plausible diagnosis [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report. The patient's facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and hypotonia are consistent with Kabuki syndrome. While not identified in other tools, the strong rank and phenotype match support its inclusion [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: Cornelia de Lange syndrome is ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report. The patient's craniofacial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, and limb anomalies align with the clinical features of this syndrome. However, it is less strongly supported across other tools [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: CHD8-related neurodevelopmental disorder (CHD8-NDD)  \nOMIM: OMIM:615032  \nDescription: CHD8-NDD is supported by literature findings, particularly the combination of macrocephaly, developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder features, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The absence of cardiac anomalies and severe hypotonia differentiates it from other overgrowth syndromes, making it a plausible diagnosis [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Corpus callosum, agenesis of, with impaired intellectual development, ocular coloboma, and micrognathia  \nOMIM: OMIM:300472  \nDescription: This syndrome is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.840). The patient's intellectual disability, coloboma, and craniofacial anomalies align with the clinical features of this disorder. However, it is less strongly supported across other tools [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Peters plus syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:261540  \nDescription: Peters plus syndrome is identified in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.796). The patient's craniofacial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and skeletal anomalies are consistent with this diagnosis. However, it is less strongly supported across other tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Van Maldergem syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:601390  \nDescription: Van Maldergem syndrome is identified in GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.463). The patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay align with the clinical features of this syndrome. However, the lower score and lack of consensus across tools reduce its plausibility [2].  \n\n---"
