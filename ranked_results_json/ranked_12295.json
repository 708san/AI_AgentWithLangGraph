  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 11  \nOMIM: OMIM:618499  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to the strong phenotype similarity score (0.858) and the overlap with the patient's features, including short stature, congenital heart defects, and facial dysmorphology. These findings align with the clinical presentation of Noonan syndrome [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Yuan-Harel-Lupski syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:616652  \nDescription: The high phenotype similarity score (0.857) supports this diagnosis. The syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features, which are consistent with the patient's clinical findings [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by its high rank in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report (Rank: 2) and the presence of features such as intellectual disability, growth retardation, and distinctive facial features, which match the patient's phenotype [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Chromosome 15q24 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:615217  \nDescription: The PubCaseFinder score (0.819) and the patient's clinical features, including developmental delay and craniofacial anomalies, strongly suggest this diagnosis. Chromosome 15q24 deletion syndrome is known for its phenotypic overlap with intellectual disability syndromes [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked, syndromic 33  \nOMIM: OMIM:300818  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the PubCaseFinder score (0.830) and the GestaltMatcher report, which identified a related X-linked intellectual disability disorder (XLID93). The patient's intellectual disability and dysmorphic features align with this condition [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 was ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, and the patient's dysmorphic features, developmental delay, and hypotonia are consistent with this syndrome. However, it is ranked lower due to less consensus across tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Basilicata-Akhtar syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:301032  \nDescription: The phenotype similarity score (0.851) supports this diagnosis. Basilicata-Akhtar syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies, which overlap with the patient's clinical presentation [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type IIT  \nOMIM: OMIM:615832  \nDescription: The PubCaseFinder score (0.838) suggests this diagnosis, which is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. These findings partially align with the patient's phenotype [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:613684  \nDescription: This diagnosis was ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. The patient's intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies are consistent with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, but it is ranked lower due to limited evidence from other tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal recessive 73  \nOMIM: OMIM:619717  \nDescription: The phenotype similarity score (0.837) supports this diagnosis. The patient's intellectual disability and dysmorphic features align with this autosomal recessive condition [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Smith-Magenis syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:182290  \nDescription: Ranked fourth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, Smith-Magenis syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, and dysmorphic features. However, it is ranked lower due to limited consensus across tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Autosomal dominant intellectual disability-craniofacial anomalies-cardiac defects syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:617352  \nDescription: The PubCaseFinder score (0.810) supports this diagnosis. The patient's intellectual disability, craniofacial anomalies, and congenital heart defects align with this syndrome [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: White-Sutton syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:616364  \nDescription: Identified in the GestaltMatcher report (Score: 0.458), this syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. However, it is ranked lower due to weaker evidence compared to other diagnoses [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Nizon-Isidor syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:618103  \nDescription: The PubCaseFinder score (0.808) suggests this diagnosis, which is characterized by developmental delay and dysmorphic features. However, it is ranked lower due to limited consensus across tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: Schaaf-Yang syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:615547  \nDescription: Identified in the GestaltMatcher report (Score: 0.437), Schaaf-Yang syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability and hypotonia. It is ranked lower due to weaker evidence compared to other diagnoses [3].  \n\n"
