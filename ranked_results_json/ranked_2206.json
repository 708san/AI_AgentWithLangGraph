Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder - Wikipedia\n  Snippet: The provided text appears to be medically related. Below is the structured summary based on the provided content:\n\n---\n\n**Disease:** Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD)\n\n**Genetics:** Not applicable; FASD is not a genetic condition but results from prenatal alcohol exposure.\n\n**Key Phenotypes:**\n- Short palpebral fissure lengths\n- Smooth philtrum\n- Thin upper lip\n\n**Differentiating Features:**\n- Facial dysmorphisms, particularly the combination of short palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, and thin upper lip, are distinguishing features of FASD.\n- These features are associated with prenatal alcohol exposure and are not typically seen in other syndromes without a history of teratogenic exposure.\n\n**Hallmark(s):**\n- Smooth philtrum\n- Thin upper lip\n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**\n- Absence of genetic inheritance pattern (distinguishing it from genetic syndromes with overlapping features).\n\n**Unique Constellation:**\n- The triad of short palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, and thin upper lip in the context of prenatal alcohol exposure is highly suggestive of FASD.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or additional details!\n- Title: Thin upper lip vermilion (Concept Id: C1865017) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Femoral-Facial Syndrome (FFS), also known as Femoral Hypoplasia-Unusual Facies Syndrome (FHUFS)\n\n**Genetics:**  \n- No specific causative gene identified.  \n- Typically sporadic in occurrence; no clear inheritance pattern established.\n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Bilateral or unilateral femoral hypoplasia or aplasia.  \n- Characteristic facial features, including a short nose with a broad nasal bridge, long philtrum, and thin upper lip.  \n- Limb anomalies, particularly affecting the lower extremities.  \n- Variable involvement of other systems, such as cardiac or renal anomalies.  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Predominant hypoplasia or aplasia of the femur, which is a defining skeletal feature.  \n- Distinctive facial dysmorphism, particularly the combination of a short nose and long philtrum.  \n- Absence of upper limb involvement, which helps distinguish it from other syndromes with limb anomalies.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Femoral hypoplasia or aplasia in conjunction with the characteristic facial features.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of upper limb malformations, which are often present in other syndromes with limb anomalies.  \n- No evidence of intellectual disability, which is a feature in some other syndromes with congenital anomalies.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The combination of femoral hypoplasia or aplasia, characteristic facial features (short nose, broad nasal bridge, long philtrum), and absence of upper limb anomalies strongly suggests Femoral-Facial Syndrome.\n",
