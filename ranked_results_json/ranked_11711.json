Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible.

Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia and speech delay, with or without seizures (NEDHSS)  \nOMIM: Not available  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's global developmental delay, hypotonia, and speech delay, which align with the hallmark features of NEDHSS [1]. The absence of dysmorphic facial features and systemic organ involvement further strengthens this diagnosis, as these are key negative findings that differentiate NEDHSS from other syndromes with similar phenotypes [2]. Additionally, the variability in seizure presence and progressive motor regression are unique to this disorder [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: The high score (0.837) from PubCaseFinder suggests strong phenotype overlap with the patient's features, including intellectual disability, craniofacial anomalies, and developmental delay [1]. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is further supported by the presence of hypotonia and speech delay, which are commonly reported in affected individuals [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 8  \nOMIM: OMIM:615355  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the high phenotype similarity score (0.846) from the Phenotype Similarity Search tool and the presence of features such as developmental delay, hypotonia, and cardiac anomalies [1]. Noonan syndrome is also consistent with the patient's craniofacial features, which overlap with the syndrome's characteristic dysmorphology [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 was ranked second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, indicating strong plausibility based on phenotype overlap. The patient's developmental delay, hypotonia, and speech delay align with the syndrome's hallmark features [1]. Additionally, Kabuki syndrome is known for its distinctive craniofacial features, which may be present in the patient [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300963  \nDescription: The high score (0.860) from the Phenotype Similarity Search tool suggests significant overlap with the patient's phenotype, including developmental delay, hypotonia, and craniofacial anomalies [1]. Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome is further supported by the presence of cardiac anomalies, which are commonly associated with this disorder [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 was ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, indicating strong plausibility based on phenotype overlap. The patient's developmental delay, hypotonia, and speech delay are consistent with the syndrome's features [1]. Additionally, the presence of craniofacial anomalies aligns with the syndrome's characteristic dysmorphology [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:607872  \nDescription: The high score (0.824) from PubCaseFinder suggests significant phenotype overlap, including developmental delay, hypotonia, and intellectual disability [1]. Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome is also associated with craniofacial anomalies and cardiac defects, which may be present in the patient [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Basilicata-Akhtar syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:301032  \nDescription: The high score (0.857) from the Phenotype Similarity Search tool supports this diagnosis, particularly given the patient's developmental delay, hypotonia, and speech delay [1]. Basilicata-Akhtar syndrome is further characterized by craniofacial anomalies, which may overlap with the patient's features [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Fontaine progeroid syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:616793  \nDescription: The score (0.818) from PubCaseFinder suggests moderate phenotype overlap, including developmental delay and craniofacial anomalies [1]. Fontaine progeroid syndrome is less likely due to the absence of progeroid features in the patient, but it remains a plausible candidate [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Peroxisome biogenesis disorder 1A (Zellweger syndrome)  \nOMIM: OMIM:214100  \nDescription: The score (0.811) from PubCaseFinder suggests moderate phenotype overlap, including developmental delay and hypotonia [1]. However, the absence of systemic organ involvement, such as liver dysfunction or retinal abnormalities, makes this diagnosis less likely [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Craniofrontonasal syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:304110  \nDescription: Ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool, this syndrome is supported by the presence of craniofacial anomalies and developmental delay [1]. However, the absence of other hallmark features, such as hypertelorism or coronal craniosynostosis, reduces its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Schinzel-Giedion midface retraction syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:269150  \nDescription: The GestaltMatcher score (0.511) suggests mild phenotype overlap, including craniofacial anomalies and developmental delay [1]. However, the absence of midface retraction and other distinctive features makes this diagnosis less likely [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:115150  \nDescription: The GestaltMatcher score (0.501) suggests mild phenotype overlap, including craniofacial anomalies and developmental delay [1]. However, the absence of cutaneous findings and other hallmark features reduces its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Craniosynostosis  \nOMIM: OMIM:123100  \nDescription: The GestaltMatcher score (0.496) suggests mild phenotype overlap, particularly craniofacial anomalies [1]. However, the absence of premature suture closure or other distinctive features makes this diagnosis less likely [2].  \n\n"
