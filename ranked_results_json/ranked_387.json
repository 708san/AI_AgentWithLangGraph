Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:122470  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.845) and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 4). The patient’s phenotype of intellectual disability, microcephaly, and behavioral abnormalities aligns with the hallmark features of Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Additionally, facial dysmorphology findings such as synophrys and long eyelashes further strengthen this diagnosis [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:147920  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 1 is ranked highly in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report (Rank: 1) and is characterized by intellectual disability, craniofacial anomalies, and developmental delay, which overlap with the patient’s phenotype. Facial dysmorphology findings, such as long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid, are consistent with Kabuki syndrome [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:607872  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.857). The patient’s intellectual disability, microcephaly, and behavioral abnormalities are hallmark features of this syndrome. Additional findings such as hypotonia and craniofacial anomalies further align with the phenotype [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 80  \nOMIM: OMIM:618580  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search ranked this diagnosis with the highest score (0.906). The presence of developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures in the patient strongly supports this diagnosis. The causative gene and inheritance pattern should be explored further to confirm [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 57  \nOMIM: OMIM:618050  \nDescription: This diagnosis is ranked second in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.905). The patient’s intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies are consistent with the described phenotype. Further genetic testing may help confirm this diagnosis [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Weaver syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:277590  \nDescription: Literature review highlights Weaver syndrome as a plausible diagnosis due to the patient’s craniofacial anomalies, including broad forehead and ocular hypertelorism, as well as accelerated growth and advanced bone age. The absence of significant intellectual disability differentiates it from other overgrowth syndromes [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome is ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. The presence of coloboma, heart defects, and craniofacial anomalies in the patient aligns with this diagnosis. However, the lack of consensus across tools lowers its ranking [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 40  \nOMIM: OMIM:616779  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified this diagnosis with a moderate score (0.480). The patient’s intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies are consistent with the phenotype. Additional evidence is needed to confirm [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Seckel syndrome 11  \nOMIM: OMIM:620767  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search ranked this diagnosis highly (Score: 0.902). The patient’s microcephaly and intellectual disability align with the features of Seckel syndrome. However, the absence of hallmark features such as dwarfism reduces its plausibility [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Cohen syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:216550  \nDescription: Cohen syndrome is ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. The patient’s intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the lack of supporting evidence from other tools lowers its ranking [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:135900  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified Coffin-Siris syndrome with a moderate score (0.533). The patient’s intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies align with the phenotype. However, the absence of specific hallmark features such as hypoplastic nails reduces its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: White-Sutton syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:616364  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified White-Sutton syndrome with a moderate score (0.489). The patient’s intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities are consistent with the phenotype. Further genetic testing is required to confirm [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Radio-Tartaglia syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:619312  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search ranked this diagnosis with a high score (0.901). The patient’s intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies align with the phenotype. However, limited evidence from other tools reduces its plausibility [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Chromosome 18q deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:601808  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder identified this syndrome with a score of 0.837. The patient’s intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies are consistent with the phenotype. However, the lack of consensus across tools lowers its ranking [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome, X-linked  \nOMIM: OMIM:301040  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified this syndrome with a moderate score (0.482). The patient’s intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies align with the phenotype. Further genetic testing is required to confirm [3].  \n\n---"
