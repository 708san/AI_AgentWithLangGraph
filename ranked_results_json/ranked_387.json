Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

If you can provide the full article or additional context, I can assist further.\n- Title: Weaver syndrome (Concept Id: C0265210) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Weaver syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative gene: EZH2  \n- Inheritance pattern: Autosomal dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Broad forehead and face  \n- Ocular hypertelorism  \n- Prominent, wide-set eyes  \n- Accelerated growth (prenatal and postnatal overgrowth)  \n- Advanced bone age  \n- Camptodactyly (permanent flexion of fingers)  \n- Hoarse or low-pitched voice  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Broad forehead and face (distinguishes from Sotos syndrome, which has a long, narrow face)  \n- Camptodactyly (not typically seen in Sotos syndrome)  \n- Hoarse or low-pitched voice (less common in other overgrowth syndromes)  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Advanced bone age in combination with overgrowth and facial dysmorphism  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of significant intellectual disability (unlike Sotos syndrome, which often presents with developmental delay)  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Combination of prenatal and postnatal overgrowth, advanced bone age, broad forehead and face, camptodactyly, and hoarse voice strongly suggests Weaver syndrome.\n",
