Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Glycine encephalopathy with normal serum glycine  \nOMIM: OMIM:617301  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to the strong phenotype similarity score (0.808) [4]. The patient's presentation of neurodevelopmental delay and hypotonia aligns with the clinical features of glycine encephalopathy, despite normal serum glycine levels. The high score across phenotype-based tools further supports this diagnosis [1], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with spasticity and poor growth  \nOMIM: OMIM:618076  \nDescription: The phenotype similarity score (0.806) strongly supports this diagnosis [4]. The patient's symptoms of developmental delay, spasticity, and growth impairment are consistent with the clinical features described for this disorder. Consensus across multiple tools strengthens the plausibility [1], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Cardiac, facial, and digital anomalies with developmental delay  \nOMIM: OMIM:618164  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by both GestaltMatcher (score: 0.465) and phenotype similarity search (score: 0.803) [3], [4]. The patient's dysmorphic features and developmental delay align with the described phenotype. The overlap of findings across tools increases diagnostic confidence [3], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Mowat-Wilson syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:235730  \nDescription: This diagnosis was ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report [2]. The patient's neurodevelopmental delay, hypotonia, and potential dysmorphic features are consistent with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. However, the lack of consensus across other tools slightly reduces its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a high PubCaseFinder score (0.754) [1]. The patient's developmental delay and hypotonia are consistent with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, the absence of specific dysmorphic features reduces its ranking compared to other candidates [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:607872  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a PubCaseFinder score of 0.775 [1]. The patient's neurodevelopmental delay and hypotonia align with the clinical features of this syndrome. However, the lack of supporting evidence from other tools lowers its ranking [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with intracranial hemorrhage, seizures, and spasticity  \nOMIM: OMIM:620371  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a phenotype similarity score of 0.803 [4]. While the patient's developmental delay and spasticity are consistent with this disorder, the absence of intracranial hemorrhage or seizures in the clinical presentation reduces its plausibility [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Weaver syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:277590  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a PubCaseFinder score of 0.747 [1]. The patient's hypotonia and developmental delay are consistent with Weaver syndrome. However, the lack of specific dysmorphic features or consensus across tools lowers its ranking [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Pallister-W syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:601803  \nDescription: This diagnosis was ranked second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report [2]. While the patient's developmental delay and hypotonia are consistent with Pallister-W syndrome, the lack of supporting evidence from other tools reduces its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 3  \nOMIM: OMIM:617395  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a PubCaseFinder score of 0.745 [1]. The patient's hypotonia and developmental delay align with the clinical features of this disorder. However, the lack of consensus across tools lowers its ranking [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis  \nOMIM: OMIM:300373  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a PubCaseFinder score of 0.738 [1]. While the patient's developmental delay and hypotonia may overlap with this disorder, the absence of cranial sclerosis or other specific features reduces its plausibility [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Alström syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:203800  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a GestaltMatcher score of 0.455 [3]. While the patient's developmental delay and hypotonia may overlap with Alström syndrome, the absence of characteristic features such as retinal dystrophy or obesity reduces its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:216900  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a GestaltMatcher score of 0.446 [3]. The patient's developmental delay and hypotonia may overlap with this syndrome, but the absence of specific oculocerebrofacial features reduces its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Moebius syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:157900  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a GestaltMatcher score of 0.445 [3]. While the patient's hypotonia and developmental delay may overlap with Moebius syndrome, the absence of facial paralysis or other hallmark features reduces its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: H3-3A-related disorder  \nOMIM: OMIM:617192  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by a GestaltMatcher score of 0.451 [3]. The patient's developmental delay and hypotonia may overlap with this disorder, but the lack of specific supporting features reduces its plausibility [3].  \n---"
