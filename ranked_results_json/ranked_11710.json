  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREBBP mutations  \nOMIM: OMIM:180849  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by findings across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.723) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.498). The patient’s phenotype, including facial dysmorphology and developmental delay, aligns strongly with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome [1], [2]. Additionally, the overlap of intellectual disability and characteristic facial features further strengthens this diagnosis [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 was ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report, indicating strong generative AI-based evidence. The patient’s dysmorphic features, developmental delay, and hypotonia are consistent with Kabuki syndrome [4]. While not identified in other tools, the high rank and phenotype overlap make this a plausible diagnosis [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:122470  \nDescription: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1 was identified in PubCaseFinder with a high score (0.739). The patient’s features, including developmental delay and dysmorphic facial characteristics, are consistent with this syndrome [1]. The presence of limb abnormalities, if noted, would further support this diagnosis [6].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome was ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report. The presence of coloboma, heart defects, and characteristic facial features aligns with this diagnosis [4]. While not identified in other tools, the phenotype overlap and literature support make it a reasonable consideration [7].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis  \nOMIM: OMIM:300373  \nDescription: This diagnosis was identified in PubCaseFinder with a score of 0.744, the highest among its results. The patient’s cranial sclerosis and skeletal abnormalities, if present, strongly support this diagnosis [1]. However, the lack of consensus across tools slightly reduces its plausibility [8].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Cardiospondylocarpo-facial syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:157800  \nDescription: Identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search with the highest score (0.854), this syndrome is characterized by cardiac anomalies, skeletal dysplasia, and facial dysmorphology. If the patient exhibits these features, this diagnosis is plausible [9]. However, it was not identified in other tools, limiting its ranking [10].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome 12  \nOMIM: OMIM:618499  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome 12 was ranked second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report. The patient’s features, including short stature, congenital heart defects, and facial dysmorphology, align with this diagnosis [4]. However, the lack of identification in other tools reduces its ranking [11].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:216900  \nDescription: Identified in GestaltMatcher with a score of 0.487, this syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, facial dysmorphology, and ocular anomalies. The patient’s phenotype partially overlaps with this condition, but lower scores and lack of consensus reduce its plausibility [2], [12].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Alagille syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:118450  \nDescription: Alagille syndrome 1 was ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report. The patient’s features, including cholestasis, cardiac anomalies, and characteristic facial features, align with this diagnosis [4]. However, it was not identified in other tools, limiting its ranking [13].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:605130  \nDescription: Identified in GestaltMatcher with a score of 0.491, this syndrome is characterized by hypertrichosis, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphology. The patient’s phenotype partially overlaps with this condition, but lower scores and lack of consensus reduce its plausibility [2], [14].  \n\n"
