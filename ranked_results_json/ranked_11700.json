Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:601559  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the high phenotype similarity score (0.865) from PubCaseFinder, which aligns with the patient's clinical presentation of arthrogryposis, respiratory distress, and skeletal abnormalities [1]. Additionally, the syndrome's hallmark features, including congenital contractures and dysautonomia, match the patient's reported hypotonia and developmental delay [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: lethal arthrogryposis-anterior horn cell disease syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:208150  \nDescription: This condition is plausible due to its high PubCaseFinder score (0.843) and the overlap with the patient's phenotype of severe congenital contractures and hypotonia [1]. The involvement of anterior horn cells could explain the progressive weakness and respiratory failure observed [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Emanuel syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:609029  \nDescription: Emanuel syndrome is supported by literature findings describing severe developmental delay, craniofacial dysmorphism (e.g., microcephaly, cleft palate, ear anomalies), and congenital heart defects [3]. The patient's hypotonia and failure to thrive further align with this diagnosis. The presence of a supernumerary derivative chromosome 22 (der(22)t(11;22)) would be a key confirmatory finding [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Wieacker-Wolff syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:314580  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (score: 0.839) and the patient's phenotype of arthrogryposis and developmental delay [1]. The X-linked inheritance pattern and neurological involvement, including anterior horn cell dysfunction, align with the clinical presentation [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: CONGENITAL MYOPATHY 21 WITH EARLY RESPIRATORY FAILURE; CMYO21  \nOMIM: OMIM:619040  \nDescription: This diagnosis is ranked highly due to its top position in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and the patient's symptoms of hypotonia, respiratory distress, and early-onset weakness [5]. The genetic basis involving mutations in ACTA1 further supports this possibility [6].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, ESCOBAR VARIANT; EVMPS  \nOMIM: OMIM:265000  \nDescription: The presence of congenital contractures and respiratory difficulties aligns with this diagnosis, which was ranked second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report [5]. The patient's phenotype of joint contractures and hypotonia supports this possibility [6].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 5  \nOMIM: OMIM:615065  \nDescription: This condition is supported by PubCaseFinder (score: 0.839) and the patient's phenotype of multiple congenital contractures and developmental delay [1]. The genetic basis involving mutations in ECEL1 aligns with the clinical presentation [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY WITH NORMAL SERUM GLYCINE  \nOMIM: OMIM:617301  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the Phenotype Similarity Search report (score: 0.749) and the patient's symptoms of developmental delay, hypotonia, and potential metabolic involvement [7]. The absence of hyperglycinemia differentiates this from classic glycine encephalopathy [8].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: CAREY-FINEMAN-ZITER SYNDROME 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:254940  \nDescription: The patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and hypotonia align with this diagnosis, which was identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search report (score: 0.728) [7]. The presence of facial weakness and developmental delay further supports this possibility [8].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: OHDO SYNDROME, SBBYS VARIANT; SBBYSS  \nOMIM: OMIM:603736  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by GestaltMatcher (score: 0.535) and the patient's facial dysmorphology, including hypertelorism and epicanthal folds [9]. Developmental delay and hypotonia are consistent with the syndrome's phenotype [10].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: NEMALINE MYOPATHY 2; NEM2  \nOMIM: OMIM:256030  \nDescription: The patient's hypotonia and respiratory distress align with this diagnosis, which was ranked fourth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report [5]. Nemaline rods in muscle biopsy would be a key confirmatory finding [6].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: KAUFMAN OCULOCEREBROFACIAL SYNDROME; KOS  \nOMIM: OMIM:216901  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by GestaltMatcher (score: 0.483) and the patient's craniofacial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and hypotonia [9]. The genetic basis involving UBE3B mutations aligns with the clinical presentation [10].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: KOOLEN-DE VRIES SYNDROME; KDVS  \nOMIM: OMIM:610443  \nDescription: The patient's developmental delay and hypotonia align with this diagnosis, which was identified in GestaltMatcher (score: 0.472) [9]. The presence of craniofacial dysmorphism further supports this possibility [10].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 10A (ZELLWEGER)  \nOMIM: OMIM:614882  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by the Phenotype Similarity Search report (score: 0.722) and the patient's symptoms of developmental delay, hypotonia, and potential metabolic involvement [7]. The presence of craniofacial dysmorphism and liver dysfunction would further support this diagnosis [8].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: SCHUURS-HOEIJMAKERS SYNDROME; SHMS  \nOMIM: OMIM:615790  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by GestaltMatcher (score: 0.492) and the patient's craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay [9]. The genetic basis involving mutations in PACS1 aligns with the clinical presentation [10].  \n\n"
