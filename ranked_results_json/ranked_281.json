Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Postnatal growth retardation (Concept Id: C1859778) - MedGen -\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nDubowitz syndrome (DS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \nCausative gene(s): Unknown  \nInheritance pattern: Likely autosomal recessive  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Prenatal and postnatal growth retardation  \n- Microcephaly  \n- Distinctive facial features (e.g., triangular face, broad nasal bridge, high-arched palate)  \n- Eczema or other skin abnormalities  \n- Mild to moderate intellectual disability  \n- Behavioral issues, including hyperactivity and social difficulties  \n- Immunodeficiency in some cases  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of growth retardation with microcephaly and characteristic facial dysmorphism  \n- Presence of eczema or other skin abnormalities, which is less common in other syndromes with growth retardation  \n- Behavioral issues with a specific pattern of hyperactivity and social difficulties  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Distinctive facial features, including triangular face and broad nasal bridge  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of major organ malformations (e.g., cardiac or renal anomalies), which are often seen in other syndromes with growth retardation  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Triangular face, microcephaly, growth retardation, and eczema together strongly suggest Dubowitz syndrome.\n- Title: Thin upper lip vermilion (Concept Id: C1865017) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Femoral-Facial Syndrome (FFS), also known as Femoral Hypoplasia-Unusual Facies Syndrome (FHUFS)\n\n**Genetics:**  \n- No specific causative gene identified.  \n- Typically sporadic in occurrence; no clear inheritance pattern established.\n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Bilateral or unilateral femoral hypoplasia or aplasia.  \n- Characteristic facial features, including a short nose with a broad nasal bridge, long philtrum, and thin upper lip.  \n- Limb anomalies, particularly affecting the lower extremities.  \n- Variable involvement of other systems, such as cardiac or renal anomalies.  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- The combination of femoral hypoplasia or aplasia with the distinct facial dysmorphism is a key distinguishing feature.  \n- Absence of upper limb involvement, which helps differentiate it from other syndromes with limb anomalies.  \n- Typically sporadic occurrence, which contrasts with some syndromes that have a clear genetic inheritance pattern.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Femoral hypoplasia or aplasia in conjunction with the characteristic facial features.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of upper limb anomalies.  \n- No evidence of intellectual disability, which may be present in other syndromes with limb and facial anomalies.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The presence of femoral hypoplasia or aplasia, characteristic facial features (short nose, broad nasal bridge, long philtrum, thin upper lip), and absence of upper limb involvement strongly suggest Femoral-Facial Syndrome.\n",
