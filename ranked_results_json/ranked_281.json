Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Postnatal growth retardation (Concept Id: C1859778) - MedGen -\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nDubowitz syndrome (DS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \nCausative gene(s): Unknown  \nInheritance pattern: Likely autosomal recessive  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Prenatal and postnatal growth retardation  \n- Microcephaly  \n- Distinctive facial features (e.g., triangular face, broad nasal bridge, high-arched palate)  \n- Eczema or other skin abnormalities  \n- Mild to moderate intellectual disability  \n- Behavioral issues, including hyperactivity and social difficulties  \n- Immunodeficiency in some cases  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of growth retardation with microcephaly and characteristic facial dysmorphism  \n- Presence of eczema or other skin abnormalities, which is less common in other syndromes with growth retardation  \n- Behavioral issues with a specific pattern of hyperactivity and social difficulties  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Distinctive facial features, including triangular face and broad nasal bridge  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of major organ malformations (e.g., cardiac or renal anomalies), which are often seen in other syndromes with growth retardation  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- Triangular face, microcephaly, growth retardation, and eczema together strongly suggest Dubowitz syndrome.\n- Title: Thin upper lip vermilion (Concept Id: C1865017) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Femoral-Facial Syndrome (FFS), also known as Femoral Hypoplasia-Unusual Facies Syndrome (FHUFS)\n\n**Genetics:**  \n- No specific causative gene identified.  \n- Typically sporadic in occurrence; no clear inheritance pattern established.\n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Bilateral or unilateral femoral hypoplasia or aplasia.  \n- Characteristic facial features, including a short nose with a broad nasal bridge, long philtrum, and thin upper lip.  \n- Limb anomalies, particularly affecting the lower extremities.  \n- Variable involvement of other systems, such as cardiac or renal anomalies.  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- The combination of femoral hypoplasia or aplasia with the distinct facial dysmorphism is a key distinguishing feature.  \n- Absence of upper limb involvement, which helps differentiate it from other syndromes with limb anomalies.  \n- Typically sporadic occurrence, which contrasts with some syndromes that have a clear genetic inheritance pattern.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Femoral hypoplasia or aplasia in conjunction with the characteristic facial features.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of upper limb anomalies.  \n- No evidence of intellectual disability, which may be present in other syndromes with limb and facial anomalies.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The presence of femoral hypoplasia or aplasia, characteristic facial features (short nose, broad nasal bridge, long philtrum, thin upper lip), and absence of upper limb involvement strongly suggest Femoral-Facial Syndrome.\n",
  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to strong consensus across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.930), Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1), and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.839). The patient's phenotype of growth retardation, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features aligns with the hallmark features of Cornelia de Lange syndrome [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 5  \nOMIM: OMIM:300882  \nDescription: Supported by the highest PubCaseFinder score (0.942), this subtype of Cornelia de Lange syndrome is also consistent with the patient's phenotype of developmental delay, microcephaly, and dysmorphic facial features. While less consensus exists across other tools, the high score suggests strong phenotypic overlap [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is ranked second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and is characterized by intellectual disability, postnatal growth retardation, and distinctive facial features, including long palpebral fissures and arched eyebrows. These features partially overlap with the patient's phenotype, making this diagnosis plausible [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:614607  \nDescription: Coffin-Siris syndrome 2 was ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and is associated with developmental delay, coarse facial features, and hypotonia. While the phenotype partially overlaps with the patient's presentation, the evidence is less robust compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:605130  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identified Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome with a moderate score (0.445). This syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, hypertrichosis, and distinctive facial features, which show partial overlap with the patient's phenotype. However, the evidence is weaker compared to other candidates [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Dubowitz syndrome  \nOMIM: Not available  \nDescription: Literature review suggests Dubowitz syndrome based on the patient's microcephaly, postnatal growth retardation, and triangular facial features. The absence of major organ malformations and presence of eczema further support this diagnosis. However, the lack of consensus across analytical tools limits its ranking [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Femoral-Facial Syndrome  \nOMIM: Not available  \nDescription: Literature review highlights Femoral-Facial Syndrome due to the presence of thin upper lip vermilion and broad nasal bridge. However, the absence of femoral hypoplasia or aplasia in the patient reduces the plausibility of this diagnosis [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:613684  \nDescription: Ranked fourth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 2 is associated with intellectual disability, broad thumbs, and distinctive facial features. While some features overlap, the evidence is weaker compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:270400  \nDescription: Ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, and distinctive facial features. The phenotype partially overlaps with the patient, but the evidence is less compelling compared to other candidates [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Van Maldergem syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:601390  \nDescription: Identified by GestaltMatcher with a score of 0.439, Van Maldergem syndrome is associated with intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and limb anomalies. While some features overlap, the evidence is limited and less robust compared to other diagnoses [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, arthrogryposis, and structural brain anomalies  \nOMIM: OMIM:618622  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identified this disorder with a score of 0.838. The patient's microcephaly and developmental delay align with the syndrome, but the absence of arthrogryposis and structural brain anomalies reduces its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Kondoh syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:606242  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identified Kondoh syndrome with a score of 0.846. While microcephaly and developmental delay are consistent, the lack of distinctive facial features reduces its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Alazami-Yuan syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:617126  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identified Alazami-Yuan syndrome with a score of 0.833. This syndrome is associated with intellectual disability and microcephaly, but the absence of other hallmark features limits its plausibility [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 22  \nOMIM: OMIM:612337  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identified this disorder with a score of 0.827. While intellectual disability is consistent, the lack of distinctive facial features and other hallmark symptoms reduces its plausibility [3].  \n\n"
