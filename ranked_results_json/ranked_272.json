Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300590  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's phenotype, including facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and microcephaly, which align with the clinical features of Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 [1]. Multiple analytical tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.877), Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1), and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.917), consistently rank this syndrome highly, indicating strong consensus across methodologies [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:122470  \nDescription: The patient's phenotype, particularly facial dysmorphism and developmental delay, matches the features of Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1. PubCaseFinder ranks this syndrome highest (Score: 0.931), and GestaltMatcher also identifies Cornelia de Lange syndrome as a plausible diagnosis (Score: 0.668) [1]. While the evidence is strong, it is slightly less consistent across tools compared to Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Coffin-Siris syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:135900  \nDescription: Coffin-Siris syndrome 1 is supported by the presence of developmental delay and coarse facial features, which overlap with the patient's phenotype. PubCaseFinder ranks this syndrome highly (Score: 0.855), and Zero-Shot Diagnosis identifies Coffin-Siris syndrome 2 as a plausible candidate (Rank: 4), suggesting a broader Coffin-Siris spectrum may be relevant [1]. However, the evidence is less robust compared to Cornelia de Lange syndromes [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:613684  \nDescription: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 2 is supported by developmental delay and facial dysmorphism, which partially overlap with the patient's phenotype. Zero-Shot Diagnosis ranks this syndrome second, indicating moderate plausibility [1]. However, other tools do not strongly support this diagnosis, reducing its overall ranking [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is supported by developmental delay and facial dysmorphism, which align with the patient's phenotype. Zero-Shot Diagnosis ranks this syndrome third, suggesting moderate plausibility [1]. However, no other tools strongly support this diagnosis, limiting its ranking [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Filippi syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:272440  \nDescription: Filippi syndrome is supported by the presence of syndactyly, postnatal microcephaly, and developmental delay, which align with the patient's phenotype. Literature review highlights the unique constellation of features, including unusual dental findings, which may differentiate this syndrome from others [1]. However, no analytical tools explicitly rank this syndrome, reducing its overall plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Seckel syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:210600  \nDescription: Seckel syndrome is supported by severe microcephaly, prenatal growth restriction, and developmental delay, which partially overlap with the patient's phenotype. Literature review highlights the hallmark \"bird-like\" facial appearance, which may align with the patient's dysmorphic features [1]. However, no analytical tools explicitly rank this syndrome, and the evidence is less robust compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia  \nOMIM: OMIM:607596  \nDescription: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia is supported by developmental delay and microcephaly, which partially overlap with the patient's phenotype. GestaltMatcher identifies this syndrome as a plausible candidate (Score: 0.482) [1]. However, the evidence is limited and less consistent across tools, reducing its ranking [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:270400  \nDescription: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is supported by developmental delay and facial dysmorphism, which partially overlap with the patient's phenotype. Zero-Shot Diagnosis ranks this syndrome fifth, suggesting low plausibility [1]. However, other tools do not strongly support this diagnosis, limiting its ranking [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Luo-Schoch-Yamamoto syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:619460  \nDescription: Luo-Schoch-Yamamoto syndrome is supported by developmental delay and facial dysmorphism, which partially overlap with the patient's phenotype. Phenotype Similarity Search ranks this syndrome moderately (Score: 0.890) [1]. However, the evidence is less robust compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Pierpont syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:602342  \nDescription: Pierpont syndrome is supported by developmental delay and facial dysmorphism, which partially overlap with the patient's phenotype. Phenotype Similarity Search ranks this syndrome moderately (Score: 0.888) [1]. However, the evidence is less robust compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Chromosome 3pter-p25 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:613792  \nDescription: Chromosome 3pter-p25 deletion syndrome is supported by developmental delay and facial dysmorphism, which partially overlap with the patient's phenotype. Phenotype Similarity Search ranks this syndrome moderately (Score: 0.886) [1]. However, the evidence is less robust compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [2].  \n\n"
