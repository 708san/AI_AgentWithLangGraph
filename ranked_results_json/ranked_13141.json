  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Noonan syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:163950  \nDescription: Noonan syndrome is strongly supported by multiple tools, including GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.569), Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1), and Phenotype Similarity Search (multiple subtypes with high scores: OMIM: 615355, OMIM: 616559, OMIM: 619745). The patient's phenotype, including short stature, facial dysmorphology, and congenital heart defects, aligns with the clinical features of Noonan syndrome [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:115150  \nDescription: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.978) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.543). The patient’s phenotype, including craniofacial anomalies, developmental delay, and skin abnormalities, matches the diagnostic criteria for this syndrome [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:300867  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 2 is ranked fourth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and is supported by the presence of intellectual disability, developmental delay, and characteristic facial features. Although less strongly supported than other diagnoses, the phenotype overlap warrants consideration [2], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Peters plus syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:261540  \nDescription: Peters plus syndrome is identified in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.929). The patient’s phenotype, including anterior eye segment dysgenesis and developmental delay, aligns with the clinical features of this syndrome. However, it is less strongly supported compared to other candidates [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Autosomal dominant intellectual disability-craniofacial anomalies-cardiac defects syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:617352  \nDescription: This syndrome is highlighted in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.957). The combination of intellectual disability, craniofacial anomalies, and cardiac defects matches the patient’s phenotype. However, it is ranked lower due to limited consensus across tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:601321  \nDescription: Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome is identified in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.952). The overlap of features such as short stature, facial dysmorphology, and developmental delay supports this diagnosis. However, it is less plausible due to weaker evidence from other tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Cree impaired intellectual development syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:606851  \nDescription: Cree impaired intellectual development syndrome is identified in Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.796). The patient’s intellectual disability and developmental delay align with this diagnosis, but it is ranked lower due to limited evidence from other tools [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Branchial arch syndrome, X-linked  \nOMIM: OMIM:301950  \nDescription: Branchial arch syndrome, X-linked, is identified in Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.808). The craniofacial anomalies and developmental delay partially align with the patient’s phenotype, but the evidence is weaker compared to other candidates [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Cayler cardiofacial syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:225020  \nDescription: Cayler cardiofacial syndrome is ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report. The presence of cardiac defects and facial anomalies supports this diagnosis, but it is less plausible due to limited consensus across tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia  \nOMIM: OMIM:215150  \nDescription: Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia is identified in GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.517). The skeletal anomalies and developmental delay partially align with the patient’s phenotype, but the evidence is weaker compared to other candidates [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: COL11A2-related disorders  \nOMIM: OMIM:120290  \nDescription: COL11A2-related disorders are identified in GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.518). The craniofacial and skeletal anomalies partially align with the patient’s phenotype, but the evidence is limited [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: DPH5-related disorders  \nOMIM: OMIM:616462  \nDescription: DPH5-related disorders are identified in GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.513). The developmental delay and craniofacial anomalies partially align with the patient’s phenotype, but the evidence is weaker compared to other candidates [3].  \n---"
