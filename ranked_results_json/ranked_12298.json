  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Ccakids Syndromes\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene: *RPS6KA3*  \n- Inheritance Pattern: X-linked dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Craniofacial abnormalities: Maxillary hypoplasia, prominent forehead, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, and large, soft hands.  \n- Skeletal abnormalities: Short stature, kyphoscoliosis, pectus excavatum, and tapering fingers.  \n- Neurological features: Intellectual disability (mild to severe), hypotonia, and episodes of drop attacks (sudden loss of muscle tone).  \n- Other features: Delayed motor milestones and progressive joint laxity.  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Presence of drop attacks, which are sudden and transient episodes of muscle tone loss, is a distinguishing feature.  \n- Progressive joint laxity and soft, fleshy hands are notable and help differentiate CLS from other syndromes with intellectual disability.  \n- The combination of craniofacial dysmorphism (e.g., maxillary hypoplasia, hypertelorism) with skeletal abnormalities and intellectual disability is characteristic.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Drop attacks (sudden loss of muscle tone).  \n- Soft, fleshy hands with tapering fingers.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of organomegaly, which may be present in other syndromes with intellectual disability.  \n- No evidence of metabolic abnormalities, which are common in some other syndromes with similar features.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The triad of craniofacial dysmorphism (e.g., maxillary hypoplasia, hypertelorism), intellectual disability, and drop attacks strongly suggests Coffin-Lowry Syndrome.\n- Title: Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia and speech delay,\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nNeurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia and speech delay, with or without seizures (NEDHSS)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene(s): Variants in the IRF2BPL gene  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Global developmental delay  \n- Hypotonia  \n- Speech delay or absence of speech  \n- Intellectual disability  \n- Seizures (may or may not be present)  \n- Motor regression in some cases  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Progressive motor regression, which is not typically seen in many other neurodevelopmental disorders with hypotonia and speech delay.  \n- Variability in seizure presence, which can help distinguish it from syndromes where seizures are a universal feature.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Pathogenic variants in the IRF2BPL gene.  \n- Progressive motor regression combined with speech delay.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of dysmorphic facial features, which are often present in other syndromes with developmental delay.  \n- No consistent organ malformations, unlike some other syndromes with neurodevelopmental delay.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The combination of global developmental delay, hypotonia, speech delay, and progressive motor regression, with or without seizures, strongly suggests NEDHSS, especially in the presence of IRF2BPL gene variants.\n",
