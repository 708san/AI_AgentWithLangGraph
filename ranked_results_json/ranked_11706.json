Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Highly arched eyebrow (Concept Id: C1868571) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to create a structured summary. Please provide the full article or additional details for me to proceed.\n- Title: Hypermetropia (Concept Id: C0020490) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nBlepharophimosis, Ptosis, and Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene(s): FOXL2  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Blepharophimosis (narrowing of the eye opening)  \n- Ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid)  \n- Epicanthus inversus (upward fold of the skin of the lower eyelid near the inner corner of the eye)  \n- Telecanthus (increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of eyelid malformations (blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus) with telecanthus is highly suggestive of BPES.  \n- Type I BPES is associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in females, while Type II BPES is not.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- The triad of blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of systemic malformations or intellectual disability, which may be present in other syndromes with ptosis or eyelid abnormalities.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The presence of blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus, particularly when combined with a family history of autosomal dominant inheritance and/or premature ovarian insufficiency in females, strongly points to BPES.\n",
