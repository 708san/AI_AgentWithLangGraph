Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Downslanted palpebral fissures (Concept Id: C0423110) - MedGen\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to create a structured summary. Please provide the full article or additional details for me to proceed.\n- Title: Abnormal corpus callosum morphology (Concept Id: C1842581) -\n  Snippet: **Disease:** KMT2E-related neurodevelopmental disorder (KMT2E-NDD)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene: *KMT2E*  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Global developmental delay  \n- Variable intellectual disability (mild to severe)  \n- Speech and language delay  \n- Behavioral abnormalities (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)  \n- Hypotonia  \n- Seizures (in some cases)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Presence of both global developmental delay and behavioral abnormalities, particularly autism spectrum disorder or ADHD-like features.  \n- Intellectual disability is variable, ranging from mild to severe, which may help distinguish it from syndromes with more consistent cognitive impairment.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Pathogenic variants in *KMT2E* confirmed via genetic testing.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of dysmorphic facial features, which are often present in other syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders.  \n- No consistent organ malformations, unlike other syndromes with neurodevelopmental delay.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The combination of global developmental delay, variable intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities (autism spectrum disorder or ADHD), and hypotonia, without dysmorphic features or organ malformations, strongly suggests KMT2E-NDD.\n",
  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies and ptosis  \nOMIM: OMIM:617333  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.905), GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.492), and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.893). The patient’s dysmorphic facial features, including ptosis, align strongly with the phenotype described in this disorder. The consensus across tools and high scores make this the most plausible diagnosis [1], [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Mowat-Wilson syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:235730  \nDescription: This diagnosis is ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report and is characterized by intellectual disability, dysmorphic facial features, and congenital anomalies such as heart defects and Hirschsprung disease. The patient’s developmental delay and dysmorphic features are consistent with this syndrome, though additional clinical findings (e.g., Hirschsprung disease) would strengthen the case [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, stereotypic hand movements, and impaired language  \nOMIM: OMIM:613443  \nDescription: This disorder is identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.870) and overlaps with the patient’s hypotonia, developmental delay, and potential language impairment. While stereotypic hand movements were not explicitly noted, the constellation of neurodevelopmental symptoms makes this a plausible candidate [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type IIT  \nOMIM: OMIM:615832  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder ranks this disorder highly (Score: 0.902). It is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features, which align with the patient’s phenotype. However, specific biochemical findings (e.g., glycosylation defects) would be required to confirm this diagnosis [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Nizon-Isidor syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:617282  \nDescription: This syndrome is ranked highly by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.899) and is associated with intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and developmental delay. The patient’s phenotype overlaps significantly with this disorder, though additional findings such as limb anomalies would further support the diagnosis [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Pitt-Hopkins syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:610954  \nDescription: Ranked second in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, this syndrome is characterized by severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and breathing abnormalities. While the patient’s developmental delay and dysmorphic features are consistent, the absence of hallmark breathing anomalies makes this less likely [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Chromosome 15q24 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:615217  \nDescription: PubCaseFinder identifies this syndrome with a high score (0.888). It is associated with intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and developmental delay. The patient’s phenotype aligns well, though confirmation via chromosomal microarray would be necessary [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with cerebellar atrophy and with or without seizures  \nOMIM: OMIM:618056  \nDescription: Identified in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.862), this disorder is characterized by developmental delay, seizures, and cerebellar abnormalities. While the patient’s developmental delay and seizures are consistent, cerebellar imaging findings would be required to confirm this diagnosis [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: KMT2E-related neurodevelopmental disorder  \nOMIM: OMIM:619768  \nDescription: Literature review highlights this disorder as a potential candidate due to the patient’s global developmental delay, hypotonia, and behavioral abnormalities. The absence of dysmorphic features and organ malformations aligns with the described phenotype, though genetic testing for *KMT2E* variants would be necessary for confirmation [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Kleefstra syndrome 2  \nOMIM: OMIM:617768  \nDescription: Ranked third in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, this syndrome is associated with intellectual disability, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. While the patient’s phenotype overlaps, the absence of hallmark features such as distinctive facial dysmorphology and behavioral abnormalities makes this less likely [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Neurodevelopmental disorder with speech delay and variable ocular anomalies  \nOMIM: OMIM:619989  \nDescription: Phenotype Similarity Search identifies this disorder (Score: 0.865), which is characterized by developmental delay, speech impairment, and ocular anomalies. While the patient’s developmental delay is consistent, no ocular findings were noted, making this diagnosis less plausible [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Smith-Magenis syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:182290  \nDescription: Ranked fifth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, this syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, sleep disturbances, and behavioral abnormalities. While the patient’s developmental delay aligns, the absence of hallmark sleep and behavioral features makes this diagnosis less likely [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 13  \nDisease: Coffin-Lowry syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:303600  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identifies this syndrome (Score: 0.455), which is associated with intellectual disability, hypotonia, and distinctive facial features. While the patient’s developmental delay and hypotonia are consistent, the absence of hallmark facial features reduces its plausibility [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 14  \nDisease: Angelman syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:105830  \nDescription: Ranked fourth in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis report, this syndrome is characterized by severe intellectual disability, ataxia, and a happy demeanor. While the patient’s developmental delay aligns, the absence of hallmark features such as ataxia and behavioral phenotype makes this diagnosis less likely [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 15  \nDisease: Ohdo syndrome, SBBYS variant  \nOMIM: OMIM:603736  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher identifies this syndrome (Score: 0.501), which is associated with intellectual disability and dysmorphic facial features. While the patient’s developmental delay and dysmorphic features align, the absence of hallmark features such as blepharophimosis makes this diagnosis less plausible [2].  \n\n"
