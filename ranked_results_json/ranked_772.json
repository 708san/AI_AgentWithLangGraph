Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII. Analytical Tool Reports\n\nPubCaseFinder Report (Phenotype-based):\n- intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies and ptosis (Score: 0.905)\n- congenital disorder of glycosylation, type iit (Score: 0.902)\n- Nizon-Isidor syndrome (Score: 0.899)\n- chromosome 15q24 deletion syndrome (Score: 0.888)\n- intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies, seizures, and distal limb anomalies (Score: 0.886)\n\nZero-Shot Diagnosis Report (Generative AI-based):\n- MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME; MOWS (Rank: 1)\n- PITT-HOPKINS SYNDROME; PTHS (Rank: 2)\n- KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME 2; KLEFS2 (Rank: 3)\n- ANGELMAN SYNDROME; AS (Rank: 4)\n- SMITH-MAGENIS SYNDROME; SMS (Rank: 5)\n\nGestaltMatcher Report (Facial Dysmorphology-based):\n- OHDO SYNDROME, SBBYS VARIANT; SBBYSS (Score: 0.501)\n- INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER WITH DYSMORPHIC FACIES AND PTOSIS; IDDDFP (Score: 0.492)\n- COFFIN-LOWRY SYNDROME; CLS (Score: 0.455)\n- CYSTIC FIBROSIS; CF (Score: 0.454)\n- TAF1 (Score: 0.452)\n\nPhenotype Similarity Search Report (Vector-based):\n- INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER WITH DYSMORPHIC FACIES AND PTOSIS (OMIM: 617333, Score: 0.893)\n- NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER WITH HYPOTONIA, STEREOTYPIC HAND MOVEMENTS, AND IMPAIRED LANGUAGE (OMIM: 613443, Score: 0.870)\n- NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER WITH SPEECH DELAY AND VARIABLE OCULAR ANOMALIES (OMIM: 619989, Score: 0.865)\n- NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER WITH CEREBELLAR ATROPHY AND WITH OR WITHOUT SEIZURES (OMIM: 618056, Score: 0.862)\n- NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER WITH HEARING LOSS AND SPASTICITY (OMIM: 619616, Score: 0.855)\n\nIII. Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Downslanted palpebral fissures (Concept Id: C0423110) - MedGen\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to create a structured summary. Please provide the full article or additional details for me to proceed.\n- Title: Abnormal corpus callosum morphology (Concept Id: C1842581) -\n  Snippet: **Disease:** KMT2E-related neurodevelopmental disorder (KMT2E-NDD)  \n\n**Genetics:**  \n- Causative Gene: *KMT2E*  \n- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Global developmental delay  \n- Variable intellectual disability (mild to severe)  \n- Speech and language delay  \n- Behavioral abnormalities (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)  \n- Hypotonia  \n- Seizures (in some cases)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Presence of both global developmental delay and behavioral abnormalities, particularly autism spectrum disorder or ADHD-like features.  \n- Intellectual disability is variable, ranging from mild to severe, which may help distinguish it from syndromes with more consistent cognitive impairment.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Pathogenic variants in *KMT2E* confirmed via genetic testing.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of dysmorphic facial features, which are often present in other syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders.  \n- No consistent organ malformations, unlike other syndromes with neurodevelopmental delay.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The combination of global developmental delay, variable intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities (autism spectrum disorder or ADHD), and hypotonia, without dysmorphic features or organ malformations, strongly suggests KMT2E-NDD.\n",
