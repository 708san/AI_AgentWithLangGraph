  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Slender long bone (Concept Id: C1833144) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: The provided text is incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to create a structured summary.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Cutis laxa, autosomal recessive, type IIA (ARCL2A)  \nOMIM: OMIM:219200  \nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by consensus across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.833), Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 2), and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.757). The patient's phenotype of loose, wrinkled skin and connective tissue abnormalities aligns with the hallmark features of ARCL2A. Additionally, facial dysmorphology findings from GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.554) further support this diagnosis [1], [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Wrinkly skin syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:278250  \nDescription: Wrinkly skin syndrome is a plausible diagnosis based on high scores from PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.818) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.750). The patient's presentation of generalized skin laxity and connective tissue involvement matches the clinical features of this syndrome. While not ranked as highly in other tools, the overlap in phenotypic features strengthens its plausibility [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: ALDH18A1-related de Barsy syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:239200  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.816) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.468). The patient's symptoms of progeroid appearance, connective tissue abnormalities, and potential intellectual disability align with the clinical features of de Barsy syndrome. While the evidence is less robust compared to ARCL2A, the phenotypic overlap warrants consideration [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliotic type 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:225400  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.808) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.774 for a related Ehlers-Danlos subtype). The patient's connective tissue abnormalities, including hypermobility and skin laxity, are consistent with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. However, the lack of specific findings such as kyphoscoliosis or ocular fragility reduces its ranking [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, dermatosparaxis type (EDSDERMS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:225410  \nDescription: This diagnosis is ranked first in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis tool and is supported by the patient's generalized skin fragility and connective tissue abnormalities. However, it is less strongly supported by other tools, which prioritize ARCL2A and wrinkly skin syndrome. The phenotypic overlap with other connective tissue disorders makes this diagnosis plausible but less definitive [2], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:264090  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.802) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.549 for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, a phenotypically similar condition). The patient's progeroid appearance and connective tissue abnormalities align with Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome. However, the lack of specific findings such as neonatal onset or severe growth retardation reduces its ranking [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Hutchinson-Gilford progeria  \nOMIM: OMIM:176670  \nDescription: GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.549) suggests Hutchinson-Gilford progeria as a potential diagnosis based on facial dysmorphology. However, the absence of hallmark features such as severe growth retardation and cardiovascular complications makes this diagnosis less plausible compared to other connective tissue disorders [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: KBG syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:148050  \nDescription: KBG syndrome is supported by literature findings describing distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and skeletal anomalies. While the patient's phenotype overlaps with some features of KBG syndrome, the absence of hallmark findings such as macrodontia of the upper central incisors reduces its plausibility. This diagnosis is less strongly supported by the analytical tools [4].  \n\n"
