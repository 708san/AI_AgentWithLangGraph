Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\nYour final output must be a numbered list. Each line should contain only the rank, disease name, and OMIM ID. Do not include any reasoning or other text.\n\n**Example Output:**\n1. DISEASE NAME 1 (OMIM:XXXXXX)\n2. DISEASE NAME 2 (OMIM:YYYYYY)\n3. DISEASE NAME 3 (OMIM:ZZZZZZ)\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Please provide the full article or additional details for me to proceed.\n- Title: Prominent nasal bridge (Concept Id: C1854113) - MedGen - NCBI\n  Snippet: **Disease:**  \nKBG syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:**  \nCausative gene: *ANKRD11*  \nInheritance pattern: Autosomal dominant  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Macrodontia, particularly of the upper central incisors  \n- Triangular face  \n- Short stature  \n- Skeletal anomalies (e.g., costovertebral abnormalities)  \n- Developmental delay and/or intellectual disability  \n- Distinctive facial features (e.g., prominent eyebrows, synophrys, hypertelorism, long philtrum)  \n- Hearing loss  \n- Behavioral issues (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, hyperactivity)  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Presence of macrodontia, especially of the upper central incisors, which is uncommon in other syndromes with overlapping features.  \n- Combination of intellectual disability with specific craniofacial dysmorphism and skeletal anomalies.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Macrodontia of the upper central incisors.  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Absence of significant organ malformations (e.g., cardiac or renal anomalies), which are often seen in other syndromes with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The triad of macrodontia (upper central incisors), triangular face, and developmental delay/intellectual disability strongly suggests KBG syndrome, especially when accompanied by skeletal anomalies and behavioral issues.\n",
