  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome is strongly supported by multiple analytical tools, including its top rank in the Zero-Shot Diagnosis Report and a high score (0.822) in the PubCaseFinder Report. The patient’s phenotype, including coloboma, heart defects, and potential hearing impairment, aligns with the clinical features of CHARGE syndrome [1], [2]. Additionally, the Phenotype Similarity Search Report highlights related conditions involving coloboma and hearing impairment, further supporting this diagnosis [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Branchiooculofacial syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:113620  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible based on its top score (0.960) in the PubCaseFinder Report. The patient’s phenotype, including branchial anomalies and facial dysmorphology, matches the clinical features of this syndrome [1]. While other tools did not prioritize this condition, the strong phenotype match warrants its high ranking [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:194190  \nDescription: Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is supported by a high score (0.845) in the PubCaseFinder Report. The patient’s facial dysmorphology, including microcephaly and prominent glabella, aligns with this diagnosis [1]. While not ranked highly by other tools, the phenotype overlap and literature support make this a plausible candidate [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Focal dermal hypoplasia  \nOMIM: OMIM:305600  \nDescription: Focal dermal hypoplasia is supported by a high score (0.853) in the PubCaseFinder Report. The patient’s skin findings, such as linear hypoplasia and potential limb anomalies, are consistent with this diagnosis [1]. However, the lack of consensus across other tools lowers its ranking [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Oculoauricular syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:612109  \nDescription: Oculoauricular syndrome is supported by a high score (0.819) in the Phenotype Similarity Search Report. The patient’s phenotype, including ocular anomalies and potential hearing impairment, aligns with this diagnosis [3]. While not prioritized by other tools, the phenotype match and literature support justify its inclusion [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Kapur-Toriello syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:211950  \nDescription: Kapur-Toriello syndrome is supported by a moderate score (0.828) in the PubCaseFinder Report.
