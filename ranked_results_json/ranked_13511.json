Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Branchiooculofacial syndrome (BOFS)  \nOMIM: OMIM:113620  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to its consistent ranking across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (highest score: 1.000), Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 2), and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.485). The patient's phenotype aligns with BOFS features such as branchial cleft anomalies, ocular abnormalities, and facial dysmorphology [1], [2]. The consensus across tools strongly supports this diagnosis.  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: CHARGE syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:214800  \nDescription: CHARGE syndrome is supported by its high rank in Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1) and a strong score in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.841). The presence of coloboma, heart defects, and other hallmark features of CHARGE syndrome in the patient's phenotype makes this diagnosis clinically plausible [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Treacher Collins syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:154500  \nDescription: Treacher Collins syndrome 1 is supported by its high score in the Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.780) and its inclusion in Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 5). The patient's craniofacial abnormalities, including malar hypoplasia and micrognathia, are consistent with this diagnosis [2], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:147920  \nDescription: Kabuki syndrome 1 is ranked third in Zero-Shot Diagnosis and is supported by overlapping features such as developmental delay and facial dysmorphology. However, it is less strongly supported by other tools, lowering its rank [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Baraitser-Winter syndrome 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:614583  \nDescription: Baraitser-Winter syndrome 1 is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.825) and is characterized by intellectual disability, brain malformations, and distinctive facial features. While the phenotype partially overlaps with the patient’s presentation, it is less consistently ranked across tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:194190  \nDescription: Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.820) and is characterized by growth delay, intellectual disability, and craniofacial dysmorphology. The phenotype partially matches the patient’s features, but it is less strongly supported by other tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, type 1  \nOMIM: OMIM:180500  \nDescription: Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, type 1 is ranked fourth in Zero-Shot Diagnosis and is associated with anterior segment dysgenesis and dental anomalies. While some features overlap with the patient’s phenotype, it is not strongly supported by other tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 8  \nDisease: Hallermann-Streiff syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:234100  \nDescription: Hallermann-Streiff syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.812) and is characterized by craniofacial dysmorphology, dental anomalies, and hypotrichosis. The phenotype partially overlaps with the patient’s presentation, but it is less consistently ranked across tools [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: White-Sutton syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:616364  \nDescription: White-Sutton syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.483) and is associated with intellectual disability and facial dysmorphology. However, it is less strongly supported by other tools, lowering its rank [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:239000  \nDescription: Hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.480) and is characterized by intellectual disability and skeletal anomalies. The phenotype partially overlaps with the patient’s features, but it is less consistently ranked across tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 40  \nOMIM: OMIM:616975  \nDescription: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 40 is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.461) and is associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability. However, it is less strongly supported by other tools [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Kleefstra syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:610253  \nDescription: Kleefstra syndrome is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.456) and is characterized by intellectual disability and distinctive facial features. The phenotype partially overlaps with the patient’s presentation, but it is less consistently ranked across tools [2].  \n\n"
