  "prompt_sent_to_api": "You are a senior clinical geneticist. Your task is to synthesize findings from the provided analytical tool reports into a single, ranked list of potential diagnoses.\n\nCreate a master list of all unique disease candidates from all reports. Then, rank them from most to least plausible based on the strength of the evidence (consensus across tools, high scores/ranks).\n\n**Output Format Requirements:**\n- Do NOT use JSON or code blocks. Use a plain text structured format.\n- For each diagnosis, use a specific block format separated by a dashed line \"---\".\n- The format must be exactly as follows:\n\n---\nRank: [Integer]\nDisease: [Disease Name]\nOMIM: [OMIM ID]\nDescription: [The diagnostic reasoning explaining why this diagnosis is clinically plausible. Must specify which of the patient's symptoms support this diagnosis and include in-text citations [1], [2] to the evidence sources.]\n---\n\n**Example Output:**\n---\nRank: 1\nDisease: Kabuki syndrome 1\nOMIM: OMIM:147920\nDescription: This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's facial dysmorphology, specifically long palpebral fissures and eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid [1]. Additionally, the overlap of global developmental delay and hypotonia matches the phenotype consensus [2].\n---\nRank: 2\nDisease: CHARGE syndrome\nOMIM: OMIM:214800\nDescription: Although the facial features show some overlap, the key reasoning here is the presence of coloboma and heart defects noted in the phenotype report [3].\n---\n\n---\nINPUT CONTEXT\n\nII.

Supporting Literature\nWeb Search Results (Literature/Case Reports):\n- Title: Fontaine progeroid syndrome - NIH Genetic Testing Registry\n  Snippet: **Disease:** Progeroid Syndrome  \n\n**Genetics:** Not specified in the provided text.  \n\n**Key Phenotypes:**  \n- Poor growth  \n- Abnormal skeletal features  \n- Distinctive craniofacial characteristics  \n\n**Differentiating Features:**  \n- Combination of poor growth with abnormal skeletal features and distinctive craniofacial characteristics, which may help distinguish it from other connective tissue disorders.  \n\n**Hallmark(s):**  \n- Distinctive craniofacial characteristics (specific details not provided in the text).  \n\n**Key Negative Finding(s):**  \n- Not specified in the provided text.  \n\n**Unique Constellation:**  \n- The triad of poor growth, abnormal skeletal features, and distinctive craniofacial characteristics strongly suggests progeroid syndrome.  \n\n(Note: The summary is limited by the lack of detailed information in the provided text.)\n",
  "ranked_list_from_gpt4o": "---\nRank: 1  \nDisease: Prader-Willi syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:176270  \nDescription: This diagnosis is highly plausible due to its strong consensus across multiple tools, including PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.849) and Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 2). The patient's phenotype of hypotonia, developmental delay, and potential feeding difficulties aligns well with the hallmark features of Prader-Willi syndrome [1], [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 2  \nDisease: Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:607872  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by high scores in PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.844) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.829). The patient's developmental delay, intellectual disability, and craniofacial anomalies are consistent with the clinical features of this syndrome [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 3  \nDisease: Smith-Magenis syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:182290  \nDescription: Smith-Magenis syndrome is ranked highly due to its appearance in both Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 3) and GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.505). The patient's behavioral abnormalities, sleep disturbances, and craniofacial dysmorphology strongly align with the syndrome's phenotype [2], [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 4  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:122470  \nDescription: Cornelia de Lange syndrome is supported by PubCaseFinder (Score: 0.807) and Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.815). The patient's features of growth retardation, limb abnormalities, and distinctive facial dysmorphology are characteristic of this condition [1], [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 5  \nDisease: Cohen syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:216550  \nDescription: Cohen syndrome is ranked highly due to its top placement in Zero-Shot Diagnosis (Rank: 1). The patient's intellectual disability, microcephaly, and potential ophthalmologic findings are consistent with the syndrome's phenotype [2].  \n\n---\nRank: 6  \nDisease: Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked 93  \nOMIM: OMIM:300905  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.548). The patient's intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies align with the features of this disorder, although evidence is less robust compared to higher-ranked diagnoses [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 7  \nDisease: Temple syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:616222  \nDescription: Temple syndrome is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.818).

The patient's intellectual disability, craniofacial anomalies, and potential cardiac defects align with the syndrome's phenotype [1].  \n\n---\nRank: 9  \nDisease: Fontaine progeroid syndrome  \nOMIM: Not available  \nDescription: Although not ranked by the analytical tools, literature review suggests this diagnosis based on the triad of poor growth, abnormal skeletal features, and distinctive craniofacial characteristics. These findings overlap with the patient's phenotype, warranting consideration despite limited evidence [5].  \n\n---\nRank: 10  \nDisease: Chung-Jansen syndrome  \nOMIM: OMIM:620073  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by GestaltMatcher (Score: 0.490). The patient's intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies are consistent with the syndrome, though evidence is weaker compared to higher-ranked candidates [4].  \n\n---\nRank: 11  \nDisease: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 3 with or without midline brain defects  \nOMIM: OMIM:610759  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.815). The patient's growth retardation and craniofacial dysmorphology align with the features of this subtype, though it is less frequently implicated compared to Cornelia de Lange syndrome overall [3].  \n\n---\nRank: 12  \nDisease: Congenital heart defects and ectodermal dysplasia  \nOMIM: OMIM:617364  \nDescription: This diagnosis is supported by Phenotype Similarity Search (Score: 0.813).
